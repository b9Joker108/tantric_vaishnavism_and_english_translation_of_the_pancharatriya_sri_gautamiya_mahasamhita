# Caveat Lector #

To read this work, it is my considererd opinion, that mandatory minimal prior reading are the entire five (5) volume *magnum opus* of [Sri Surendranath Dasgupta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surendranath_Dasgupta) (xxx), and the capstone of that work, which is the *magnum opus* of his student and disciple, [Sri Shashibhusan Dasgupta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shashibhusan_Dasgupta) (), a work which Surendranath, charged Shashibhushan do, as he lamented not giving the Sahajiya Traditions due treatment in his *magnum opus*. I cannot help but muse how the English language presentation and appreciation of the Sahajiya Traditions, would have been profoundly different, if Surendranath had treated them directly in his *magnum opus*. I posit this work in that scholar-practitioner, translator and commentarial lineage, but soo too, that of my empowered Maharajji Gurudeva, *Nitya Lila*, H.D.G. Sri Shrila A. C Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada and my Dharmarajji Gurudeva, H.E. Choegyal Namkha'i Norbu Ronpoche, *Professor Emeritus*, Tulku, Tertön, Adi-yogin and Dancer.

As the left-hand cleanses the right,
So too, does the right-hand, cleanse the left.

# Introduction #


[Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitanya_Mahaprabhu), properly Sri Krishna-Chaitanya Bharati (even though Chaitanya never used His titular Dasanami nomenclature "Bharati", post-initiation by Sri Keshava Bharati, breaking with the [Dasanami Tradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da%C5%9Ban%C4%81mi_Sampradaya) of bearing one of the ten lineal names held by their initiating guru) and [Sri Nityananda-Rama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nityananda) the Avadhuda, His close associate, were Sahajiyas. Scholars generally state that the Indic Sahajiyas commenced with Saraha and closed with the revisionist Gaudiya Vaishnava polemic against heterodox Tantric Vaishnava schools, particularly what has confusingly come to be called the "Vaishnava Sahajiyas" in English discourse, bolstered and amplified by the ascendant socio-political melieu of Colonialism and its Victorian Christian morality. The polemic and titillation against the heterodox 'Vaishnava Sahajiyas', has coloured the historical truth, that Chaitanya and Nityananda, were Sahajiyas as were all the major and minor mediaeval Vaishnava Bhakti poets, songsmiths and dramatists. Ruganuga Bhakti of Chaitanya and Nityananda, is a Sahaja Sadhana and therefore, fundamentally and inalienably, Tantric in proclivity and actuality. There was a subsequent theological structuring conducted by the [Six Goswamis of Vrindavana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Goswamis_of_Vrindavan), who were demonstrably and directly privy to a volume of Tantric Vaishnava literature of different traditions, and used this as material to frame and inform Gaudiya Vaishnava theology, practice and worldview; and particularly of acharyas subsequent to the Six Goswamis, that foregrounded Rupanuga Bhakti, following the process of [Sri Rupa Goswami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupa_Goswami) and his disciple and theological, doxological and hermeneutical prodigy, [Sri Jiva Goswami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiva_Goswami), who was too young to have associated directly with Chaitanya, in foregrounding a more rules-based and graduated path in subsequent Gaudiya Vaishnavism, but this is understood as provisional, as the goal is the devotional service in spontaneous love, a lawless or loreless love and ecstatic devotion or Ruganuga Bhakti, which is a Chaitanya Bhakti-Sahaja fusion. Curiously, quite a volume of Vaishnava tantric materials, to which the Six Goswamis were demonstrably privy, as evident from their discourse, are no longer extant, but may yet emerge in the vast volume of manuscripts and collections of uncatalogued, unpublished Vaishnava Tantric and Sahajiya literatures in public and private holdings.

## Sahajiya, Tantric, and Raganuga Bhakti in the Chaitanya Tradition

### Historical Context: Sahajiya, Tantra, and Early Vaishnavism

- **Sahajiya Traditions**: The term "Sahajiya" refers to esoteric traditions in Indian spirituality emphasizing *sahaja* (the innate or spontaneous state). Scholars trace the origins of Sahajiya thought to the Buddhist Mahasiddha Saraha (8th century), whose teachings on spontaneity and naturalness influenced later Hindu and Buddhist Tantric movements.
- **Tantric Influences**: Both Buddhist and Hindu Sahajiya traditions are deeply Tantric, employing ritual, symbolism, and inner yogic practices aimed at direct realization of the divine or ultimate reality.

### Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Nityananda, and Sahajiya

- **Chaitanya and Nityananda**: Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1533) and his close associate Sri Nityananda are foundational figures in Gaudiya Vaishnavism. Their teachings emphasize ecstatic devotion (*bhakti*) and the cultivation of spontaneous love for Krishna (*raganuga bhakti*).
- **Sahajiya Association**: While some later groups, notably the "Vaishnava Sahajiyas," claimed inspiration from Chaitanya and Nityananda, mainstream Gaudiya Vaishnavism has historically distanced itself from the heterodox Sahajiya practices, especially those involving antinomian or radical Tantric elements. However, the *raganuga* path advocated by Chaitanya—devotion arising spontaneously rather than through prescribed rules—shares conceptual ground with Sahajiya ideals of natural, uncontrived spiritual experience.

### Colonialism, Victorian Morality, and the Gaudiya Response

- **Colonial Context**: During British colonial rule, Victorian Christian morality influenced both Indian society and the interpretation of indigenous traditions. Practices considered "Tantric" or "heterodox" were often stigmatized, and the term "Sahajiya" became associated with moral laxity or deviance in colonial and missionary writings.
- **Gaudiya Vaishnava Polemic**: In response, Gaudiya theologians and reformers sought to distinguish orthodox *raganuga bhakti* from the practices of the so-called "Vaishnava Sahajiyas," emphasizing scriptural orthodoxy and distancing themselves from groups seen as transgressive.

### Theological Structuring: From Sahaja to Rupanuga

- **Six Goswamis and Systematization**: The Six Goswamis of Vrindavan, especially Rupa Goswami and Jiva Goswami, systematized Chaitanya's teachings, formulating a more rules-based, graduated path to devotional realization (*vaidhi bhakti* leading to *raganuga bhakti*). This theological structuring provided a framework to regulate and legitimize devotional practice within the broader Hindu orthodoxy.
- **Provisionality of Rules**: Despite the emphasis on rules, the ultimate goal remained *raganuga bhakti*—spontaneous, heartfelt devotion, which is seen as the true essence of Chaitanya's path. The rules are thus provisional, serving as a foundation for the eventual flowering of spontaneous love, which some scholars interpret as a form of "Chaitanya Sahajiyaism".

### Conclusion

- **Continuity and Distinction**: While Chaitanya and Nityananda's *raganuga bhakti* shares affinities with Sahajiya and Tantric ideals, mainstream Gaudiya Vaishnavism has historically differentiated itself from heterodox Sahajiya groups, especially under colonial scrutiny.
- **Scholarly Perspective**: Modern scholarship recognizes both the Tantric substratum of early Chaitanya devotion and the later theological efforts to systematize and regulate the tradition, balancing spontaneity with orthodoxy.

Curiously, quite a volume of Vaishnava tantric materials, to which the Six Goswamis were demonstrably privy, as evident from their discourse, are no longer extant, but may yet emerge in the vast volumes of uncatalogued, unpublished Vaishnava Tantric and Sahajiya literatures in public and private holdings.

Your observation is supported by both historical evidence and scholarly consensus. The **Six Goswamis of Vrindavan**—Rupa, Sanatana, Jiva, Gopala Bhatta, Raghunatha Bhatta, and Raghunatha Dasa—were prolific writers and systematizers of Gaudiya Vaishnava theology, producing foundational texts that shaped the tradition’s ritual, philosophy, and devotional practice[1][2][3][5][7]. 

However, it is widely acknowledged that **a significant volume of Vaishnava Tantric literature, including materials referenced or alluded to by the Goswamis, is no longer extant or remains unpublished and uncatalogued**. This is especially true for texts that bridge orthodox Vaishnava ritual with Tantric or Sahajiya practices, which were often marginalized, suppressed, or simply neglected in later periods—particularly under colonial and reformist influences.

Scholars note that:
- The Goswamis’ writings, such as the *Hari-bhakti-vilasa* and the *Sandarbhas*, reference ritual and theological concepts with clear Tantric resonances[3][7][8].
- Some ritual manuals (*tantras* or *paddhatis*) used in Vaishnava practice are only partially preserved, and many are known to exist in manuscript form in temple libraries, private collections, or uncatalogued archives[8][9].
- The process of cataloguing and publishing these texts is ongoing, and **new discoveries are possible** as more manuscripts are digitized and studied[9].

Therefore, your statement that "quite a volume of Vaishnava tantric materials, to which the Six Goswamis were demonstrably privy, as evident from their discourse, are no longer extant, but may yet emerge in the vast volumes of uncatalogued, unpublished Vaishnava Tantric and Sahajiya literatures in public and private holdings" is accurate and reflects the current state of Vaishnava textual studies[8][9].

I feel a key important area in understanding Chaitana Sahajiyaism and the subsequent diverse sahjiya and tantric traditions influenced by Chaitanya and His associates, that are termed heterodox or apasampradaya, and all the Vaishnava Sahajiya poets, songsmiths and kirtaniyas, is the important Anthropological disvourse of re-visionary constructed morality in the cultural climate that gave rise to Tantra and its first 'Sexual Revolution', which was also seen in the Counter Cultural Sexual Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, which is the context in which Srila Prabhupada brought Gaudiya Vaishnavismv as a newly proseletyzing  religion, to the English speaking world and establishing temples throughout the world, which fundamentally altered the religio-theological climate.

You have identified a crucial and often underexplored dimension in the study of **Chaitanya Sahajiyaism** and its related Vaishnava Tantric and Sahajiya traditions: the **anthropological discourse of morality and sexuality** that shaped, and was shaped by, these movements. This context is essential for understanding both the historical emergence of Sahajiya currents and their reception—especially in relation to later global developments such as the 1960s–70s sexual revolution and the internationalization of Gaudiya Vaishnavism.

### Historical and Cultural Climate of Tantra and Sahajiya

- The **Sahajiya tradition** in Bengal, which drew from both Buddhist and Hindu Tantric sources, developed a spiritual path that valorized the *natural*, *spontaneous* (sahaja) experience of the divine, often using the metaphor and practice of erotic love to symbolize and enact union with the divine[1][2][3][7]. 
- This tradition, which flourished from the 16th to 19th centuries, was influenced by the earlier Tantric embrace of the body and the senses as valid means to spiritual realization, and by the *bhakti* (devotional) movement’s focus on intense, personal love for God[1][2][7].
- The **Vaishnava Sahajiyas** were seen as heterodox or *apasampradaya* by mainstream Gaudiya Vaishnavism, partly due to their Tantric ritualism and their challenge to prevailing social and religious norms[2][4].

### Morality, Sexuality, and Counter-Cultural Dynamics

- The emergence of Tantra and Sahajiya traditions can be viewed as a **re-visionary construction of morality**, challenging orthodox Brahmanical and social codes by sacralizing sexuality and the body as vehicles for spiritual realization[1][2][7].
- This “first sexual revolution” in Indian religious history parallels, in some ways, the **countercultural sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s** in the West, which also questioned established moralities and foregrounded the body, sexuality, and ecstatic experience as sites of personal and spiritual liberation.

### Chaitanya, Sahajiyaism, and Modern Globalization

- **Chaitanya Mahaprabhu** and his immediate followers were not Sahajiyas in the later, ritual-Tantric sense, but their intense emotional devotion and the centrality of Radha-Krishna’s erotic love provided a powerful symbolic and theological foundation for later Sahajiya developments[1][2][5][8].
- The **Six Goswamis of Vrindavan** and their successors systematized Chaitanya’s teachings, emphasizing a more regulated path (vaidhi bhakti) but ultimately pointing toward *raganuga bhakti*—spontaneous, passionate devotion, which retains a strong “Sahaja” undertone[6][8].
- When **Srila Prabhupada** brought Gaudiya Vaishnavism to the English-speaking world in the 1960s, he did so in a climate already primed by the sexual revolution and countercultural movements. This context both facilitated the appeal of ecstatic kirtan and bhakti, and necessitated a careful negotiation of traditional Vaishnava morality and the new Western openness to sexuality and alternative spirituality.

### Anthropological and Theological Implications

- The **reconstruction of morality**—both in the original Tantric/Sahajiya context and in the modern West—has been central to the formation, reception, and polemicization of these traditions. What was once seen as *transgressive* or *heretical* became, in new contexts, a source of fascination, creativity, and even mainstream religious practice.
- The **Vaishnava Sahajiya poets, songsmiths, and kirtaniyas** played a key role in expressing and transmitting these re-visioned moralities, often through vernacular literature and music that celebrated both divine and human love[1][2][9].

### Summary

Understanding Chaitanya Sahajiyaism and its offshoots requires attention to these shifting moral and cultural climates—both in early modern Bengal and in the globalizing world of the 20th century. The interplay between **Tantric re-visioning of morality**, **bhakti emotionalism**, and **modern countercultural movements** is essential to grasping the full significance and enduring appeal of these traditions[1][2][7].

> “Vaishnava-Sahajiya, member of an esoteric Hindu movement centred in Bengal that sought religious experience through the world of the senses, specifically human sexual love... Sahaja as a system of worship was prevalent in the Tantric traditions common to both Hinduism and Buddhism in Bengal as early as the 8th–9th centuries... The Vaishnava-Sahajiya movement developed from the 17th century onward as a synthesis of these various traditions.”[1]

> “Vaiṣṇava Sahajiyā used the romance between Krishna and Radha as a metaphor for union with the innate or primordial condition (the Sahaja) present in everyone. They sought to experience that union through its physical reenactment in tantric ritual.”[2]

You missed my point. The Gaudiya Vaishnavism that Shrila Prabhupada was heir to, was a sanitized, reconstructed and reconfigured tradition, that had amplified the elements of Vaishnava puritanism in dialogue with the mores of colonising Victorian Christianity. Prabhupada was also schooled in a Christian college. So, when Prabhupada, as an elderly former business-man, was the product of his time, placeband circumstance, which was conservative. He amplified this conservatism in context of the era of Counter Culture, within which he proseletyzed and established ISKCON. Being literate in Bengali and being a Bengali Vaishnava, Prabhupada would have known that Chaitanya and Nityananda were Sahajiyas. But, if Prabhupada  had have led with the Sahajiya thread of Raganuga Bhakti, the ISKCON would have been established on unstable ground and would not have lasted.

Thank you for clarifying your point. Your analysis highlights an essential, often overlooked, dimension of **Gaudiya Vaishnavism’s modern transmission**—namely, the ways in which the tradition was **reconstructed, sanitized, and made “respectable”** in response to both colonial-era Christian morality and the demands of global missionary work in the 20th century.

Let’s break down your insight and its implications:

## The Sanitization and Reconstruction of Gaudiya Vaishnavism

### Colonial and Victorian Influences

- **Colonial Encounter:** In 19th-century Bengal, Gaudiya Vaishnavism underwent significant transformation as it came into contact with British colonial power and Victorian Christian values. Practices and teachings that were seen as “heterodox,” “tantric,” or “sensual” (such as those associated with Sahajiya traditions) were marginalized, stigmatized, or outright suppressed.
- **Respectability Politics:** Bengali Vaishnava leaders, seeking legitimacy in a new moral and political climate, emphasized scriptural orthodoxy, ritual purity, and sexual restraint. This led to a **puritanical reinterpretation** of the tradition, foregrounding the rules-based, “respectable” aspects of bhakti and downplaying or condemning Sahajiya and Tantric currents.

### Prabhupada’s Formation and Mission

- **Educational Background:** Srila Prabhupada (A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami), educated in a British Christian college and shaped by conservative Bengali society, internalized and amplified these values. His own life and teachings reflect a deep commitment to personal morality, discipline, and a clear separation from what he saw as “deviant” or “heterodox” groups.
- **Missionary Strategy:** When Prabhupada arrived in the West in the 1960s, he encountered a countercultural milieu that was, in many ways, open to the ecstatic, sensual, and mystical aspects of Indian spirituality. However, he **deliberately presented Gaudiya Vaishnavism in a conservative, rules-based, and morally upright manner**—a “sanitized” version that could withstand scrutiny and attract serious seekers.
    - **Avoidance of Sahajiya Elements:** Prabhupada was certainly aware, as a Bengali Vaishnava, of the Sahajiya and Tantric substrata of his tradition. But he saw these as dangerous, destabilizing, and likely to lead to misunderstanding or abuse—especially in the context of the Western sexual revolution.
    - **Institutional Stability:** By emphasizing discipline, celibacy, and clear boundaries, Prabhupada ensured that ISKCON would not be dismissed as just another “sex cult” or countercultural experiment, but would instead be respected as a serious, global religious movement.

### Theoretical Reflection

- **Selective Inheritance:** What you are pointing out is that **ISKCON’s global success depended on a selective inheritance of Gaudiya Vaishnavism**—one that foregrounded puritanical, scriptural, and institutional aspects, while suppressing the more radical, Sahajiya, and Tantric threads.
- **Counterfactual:** Had Prabhupada “led with the Sahajiya thread of Raganuga Bhakti,” ISKCON’s foundation would likely have been unstable—vulnerable to scandal, misunderstanding, and the very dissolution that befell many other countercultural spiritual movements of the era.

## Conclusion

Your point is crucial for understanding not only the **history of Gaudiya Vaishnavism**, but also the **dynamics of religious transmission, adaptation, and survival** in the modern world. The “sanitized” and “reconstructed” Gaudiya Vaishnavism that Prabhupada brought to the West was a product of both colonial history and the practical necessities of global missionary work. This version, while arguably less “authentic” in some respects, was precisely what allowed ISKCON to flourish and endure.

**In summary:**  
- Prabhupada’s conservatism was not accidental, but a calculated response to both his upbringing and the cultural climate he encountered.
- The suppression of Sahajiya elements was essential for ISKCON’s stability and respectability.
- This process is a textbook example of how religious traditions adapt and survive by reconstructing their past in response to new social, political, and moral realities.

If you’d like, I can provide more on how this process compares to other global religious movements or further detail on the Bengali Vaishnava context.

Who did Chaitanya receive Sanyasi initiation from and what Dasasanyasi name was he given?

**Chaitanya Mahaprabhu** received his **sannyasa initiation** from **Keshava Bharati**, a sannyasi of the Dashanami Sampradaya, which follows the Advaita Vedanta tradition of Shankaracharya[3][4][5][7]. Upon taking sannyasa, he was given the **Dasanami name "Krishna Chaitanya"** (Śrī Krishna Chaitanya), which he chose to retain rather than adopting the traditional Bharati title of his initiating guru[3][4][5].

- **Initiating Guru:** Keshava Bharati  
- **Dasanami Name Given:** Krishna Chaitanya (Śrī Krishna Chaitanya)[3][4][5]

Chaitanya Mahaprabhu preferred to keep the name Krishna Chaitanya to emphasize his role as a servant of the Lord, rather than as an impersonalist sannyasi, which was customary in the Dashanami order[5].
