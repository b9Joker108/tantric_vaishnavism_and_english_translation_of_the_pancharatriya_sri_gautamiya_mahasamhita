# Introduction #


Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Sri Nityananda Avadhuda, His close associate, were Sahajiyas. Scholars generally state that the Indic Sahajiyas commenced with Saraha and closed with the revisionist Gaudiya Vaishnava polemic against heterodox Tantric Vaishnava schools, particularly what has confusingly come to be called the "Vaishnava Sahajiyas" in English discourse, bolstered and amplified by the ascendant socio-political melieu of Colonialism and its Victorian Christian morality. The polemic and titillation against the heterodox 'Vaishnava Sahajiyas', has coloured the historical truth, that Chaitanya and Nityananda, were Sahajiyas as were all the major and minor mediaeval Vaishnava Bhakti poets and songsmiths. Ruganuga Bhakti of Chaitanya and Nityananda, is a Sahaja Sadhana and therefore, fundamentally and inalienably, Tantric in proclivity and actuality. There was a subsequent theological structuring conducted by the Six Goswamis of Vrindavana, who were demonstrably and directly privy to a volume of Tantric Vaishnava literature of different traditions, and used this as material to frame and inform Gaudiya Vaishnava theology; and particularly of acharyas subsequent to the Six Goswamis, that foregrounded Rupanuga Bhakti, following the process of Sri Rupa Goswami and his disciple and theological and hermeneutical prodigy, Sri Jiva Goswami, in foregrounding a more rules-based and graduated path in subsequent Gaudiya Vaishnavism, but this is understood as provisional, as the goal is the devotional service in spontaneous love, a lawless or loreless love and ecstatic devotion or Ruganuga Bhakti, which is a Chaitanya Bhakti-Sahaja fusion. Curiously, quite a volume of Vaishnava tantric materials, to which the Six Goswamis were demonstrably privy, as evident from their discourse, are no longer extant, but may yet emerge in the vast volumes of uncatalogued, unpublished Vaishnava Tantric and Sahajiya literatures in public and private holdings.

## Sahajiya, Tantric, and Raganuga Bhakti in the Chaitanya Tradition

### Historical Context: Sahajiya, Tantra, and Early Vaishnavism

- **Sahajiya Traditions**: The term "Sahajiya" refers to esoteric traditions in Indian spirituality emphasizing *sahaja* (the innate or spontaneous state). Scholars trace the origins of Sahajiya thought to the Buddhist Mahasiddha Saraha (8th century), whose teachings on spontaneity and naturalness influenced later Hindu and Buddhist Tantric movements.
- **Tantric Influences**: Both Buddhist and Hindu Sahajiya traditions are deeply Tantric, employing ritual, symbolism, and inner yogic practices aimed at direct realization of the divine or ultimate reality.

### Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Nityananda, and Sahajiya

- **Chaitanya and Nityananda**: Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1533) and his close associate Sri Nityananda are foundational figures in Gaudiya Vaishnavism. Their teachings emphasize ecstatic devotion (*bhakti*) and the cultivation of spontaneous love for Krishna (*raganuga bhakti*).
- **Sahajiya Association**: While some later groups, notably the "Vaishnava Sahajiyas," claimed inspiration from Chaitanya and Nityananda, mainstream Gaudiya Vaishnavism has historically distanced itself from the heterodox Sahajiya practices, especially those involving antinomian or radical Tantric elements. However, the *raganuga* path advocated by Chaitanya—devotion arising spontaneously rather than through prescribed rules—shares conceptual ground with Sahajiya ideals of natural, uncontrived spiritual experience.

### Colonialism, Victorian Morality, and the Gaudiya Response

- **Colonial Context**: During British colonial rule, Victorian Christian morality influenced both Indian society and the interpretation of indigenous traditions. Practices considered "Tantric" or "heterodox" were often stigmatized, and the term "Sahajiya" became associated with moral laxity or deviance in colonial and missionary writings.
- **Gaudiya Vaishnava Polemic**: In response, Gaudiya theologians and reformers sought to distinguish orthodox *raganuga bhakti* from the practices of the so-called "Vaishnava Sahajiyas," emphasizing scriptural orthodoxy and distancing themselves from groups seen as transgressive.

### Theological Structuring: From Sahaja to Rupanuga

- **Six Goswamis and Systematization**: The Six Goswamis of Vrindavan, especially Rupa Goswami and Jiva Goswami, systematized Chaitanya's teachings, formulating a more rules-based, graduated path to devotional realization (*vaidhi bhakti* leading to *raganuga bhakti*). This theological structuring provided a framework to regulate and legitimize devotional practice within the broader Hindu orthodoxy.
- **Provisionality of Rules**: Despite the emphasis on rules, the ultimate goal remained *raganuga bhakti*—spontaneous, heartfelt devotion, which is seen as the true essence of Chaitanya's path. The rules are thus provisional, serving as a foundation for the eventual flowering of spontaneous love, which some scholars interpret as a form of "Chaitanya Sahajiyaism".

### Conclusion

- **Continuity and Distinction**: While Chaitanya and Nityananda's *raganuga bhakti* shares affinities with Sahajiya and Tantric ideals, mainstream Gaudiya Vaishnavism has historically differentiated itself from heterodox Sahajiya groups, especially under colonial scrutiny.
- **Scholarly Perspective**: Modern scholarship recognizes both the Tantric substratum of early Chaitanya devotion and the later theological efforts to systematize and regulate the tradition, balancing spontaneity with orthodoxy.

Curiously, quite a volume of Vaishnava tantric materials, to which the Six Goswamis were demonstrably privy, as evident from their discourse, are no longer extant, but may yet emerge in the vast volumes of uncatalogued, unpublished Vaishnava Tantric and Sahajiya literatures in public and private holdings.

Your observation is supported by both historical evidence and scholarly consensus. The **Six Goswamis of Vrindavan**—Rupa, Sanatana, Jiva, Gopala Bhatta, Raghunatha Bhatta, and Raghunatha Dasa—were prolific writers and systematizers of Gaudiya Vaishnava theology, producing foundational texts that shaped the tradition’s ritual, philosophy, and devotional practice[1][2][3][5][7]. 

However, it is widely acknowledged that **a significant volume of Vaishnava Tantric literature, including materials referenced or alluded to by the Goswamis, is no longer extant or remains unpublished and uncatalogued**. This is especially true for texts that bridge orthodox Vaishnava ritual with Tantric or Sahajiya practices, which were often marginalized, suppressed, or simply neglected in later periods—particularly under colonial and reformist influences.

Scholars note that:
- The Goswamis’ writings, such as the *Hari-bhakti-vilasa* and the *Sandarbhas*, reference ritual and theological concepts with clear Tantric resonances[3][7][8].
- Some ritual manuals (*tantras* or *paddhatis*) used in Vaishnava practice are only partially preserved, and many are known to exist in manuscript form in temple libraries, private collections, or uncatalogued archives[8][9].
- The process of cataloguing and publishing these texts is ongoing, and **new discoveries are possible** as more manuscripts are digitized and studied[9].

Therefore, your statement that "quite a volume of Vaishnava tantric materials, to which the Six Goswamis were demonstrably privy, as evident from their discourse, are no longer extant, but may yet emerge in the vast volumes of uncatalogued, unpublished Vaishnava Tantric and Sahajiya literatures in public and private holdings" is accurate and reflects the current state of Vaishnava textual studies[8][9].
