This is the alternative catchment of all my diverse and somewhat delightfullyÂ unkempt and assortod work from Medium.com on the Pancharatra tradition and prep work for an English rendering of the Pancharatriya *Sri Gautamiya Mahatantram*. I will endeavour to manually update both sites in due course. This project auspice contains manifold subprojects, not least of which is a cascade and swarm of intelligent AI agents and coded system to assist in corpus management and Generative AI assistance in working with the corpus.
