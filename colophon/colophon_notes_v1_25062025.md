# Colophon Notes #

In book-publishing jargon, that “publisher/edition/ISBN” page is most often called the copyright page (or sometimes the imprint page). Technically it lives on the verso of the title page (i.e. the back side of page 1).  

Key terms:  
- Copyright page: lists the copyright notice, edition and printing history, ISBN, publisher’s address, any legal disclaimers, and credits for design/photo rights.  
- Imprint page: a synonym for “copyright page,” emphasizing the publisher’s branding and official edition data.  
- Colophon: an older or more artisanal term for a note about the book’s production (typeface, paper stock, printer); in trade publishing the term lives on mostly in scholarly or fine-press contexts.  

Bonus pointers you might find useful:  
- In a library catalog or bibliography, cataloguers refer to this as the “publication, distribution, etc., (imprint) statement.”  
- Its standardized metadata fields (publisher, place, date, ISBN) form the core of a book’s bibliographic record in ISO 690 or MARC.  
- If you’re designing your own book, make sure your ISBN agency rules (e.g. Bowker in the US, Nielsen in the UK) are followed exactly on this page to avoid retail or legal hiccups.  

Still curious? You could delve into:  
- How different style guides (Chicago, MLA, APA) want you to cite the imprint page in a bibliography.  
- The evolution of the colophon from medieval manuscripts to today’s digital-print on demand.  
- Best practices for laying out the copyright page so it’s both legible and visually integrated with your design.
