**Narayana was originally a non-Vedic tribal deity worshipped by Dravidian or tribal communities, known also as Bhagavata because he bestowed good fortune (bhagya) on his devotees, who returned this with devoted worship (bhakti)**[1][3][4]. This deity’s role mirrored that of a tribal chief who received gifts from his people and redistributed blessings among them, symbolizing a reciprocal relationship of care and protection.

Etymologically, Narayana's name is derived from Sanskrit elements:  
- *Nara* meaning **"water"** or **"man"**  
- *Yana* meaning **"vehicle," "abode,"** or **"place to rest"**  

According to Manusmriti and later texts, Narayana can be understood as **"the one who dwells in the waters"** or **"the shelter or resting place of man"**[2][5]. This imagery connects to his iconic depiction reclining on the cosmic ocean, often on the serpent Shesha, symbolizing his presence in primordial waters and his creative and sustaining power.

Scholars also suggest that Narayana’s origin may lie in ancient Dravidian or Indus Valley civilization beliefs, with linguistic links in Dravidian languages supporting this theory. For instance, the Tamil meanings of *nara* (water), *ay* (to lie in a place), and *an* (a masculine suffix) align with his traditional portrayal and further the idea that Narayana was a pre-Vedic supreme figure associated with water and life-giving forces[2][5].

Functionally, Narayana was considered a **supreme, monotheistic deity** in his own right, embodying cosmic principles of creation and preservation. His worship was central to the early Bhagavata tradition, which emphasized loving devotion and personal relationship with the deity as the source of good fortune and spiritual guidance[1][3][4].

In summary, Narayana originally was:  
- A **non-Vedic tribal god**, especially among Dravidian peoples  
- Known as **Bhagavata**, one who grants fortune and protection to devotees  
- Associated with **water and cosmic resting place**, symbolizing creation and sustenance  
- A figure deeply rooted in ancient tribal and possibly Indus Valley spiritual traditions, predating later assimilations into broader Hindu theology  
- Revered as a **supreme divine authority** who maintained a reciprocal bond with worshippers based on giving fortune and receiving devotion[1][2][3][4][5].
