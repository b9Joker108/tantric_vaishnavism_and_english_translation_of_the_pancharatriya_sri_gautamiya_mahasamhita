# Bhagavan Sri Narayana #

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Aal%C4%81k%C4%81puru%E1%B9%A3a

**Narayana was originally a non-Vedic tribal deity worshipped by Dravidian or tribal communities, known also as Bhagavata because he bestowed good fortune (bhagya) on his devotees, who returned this with devoted worship (bhakti)**[1][3][4]. This deity’s role mirrored that of a tribal chief who received gifts from his people and redistributed blessings among them, symbolizing a reciprocal relationship of care and protection.

Etymologically, Narayana's name is derived from Sanskrit elements:  
- *Nara* meaning **"water"** or **"man"**  
- *Yana* meaning **"vehicle," "abode,"** or **"place to rest"**  

According to Manusmriti and later texts, Narayana can be understood as **"the one who dwells in the waters"** or **"the shelter or resting place of man"**[2][5]. This imagery connects to his iconic depiction reclining on the cosmic ocean, often on the serpent Shesha, symbolizing his presence in primordial waters and his creative and sustaining power.

Scholars also suggest that Narayana’s origin may lie in ancient Dravidian or Indus Valley civilization beliefs, with linguistic links in Dravidian languages supporting this theory. For instance, the Tamil meanings of *nara* (water), *ay* (to lie in a place), and *an* (a masculine suffix) align with his traditional portrayal and further the idea that Narayana was a pre-Vedic supreme figure associated with water and life-giving forces[2][5].

Functionally, Narayana was considered a **supreme, monotheistic deity** in his own right, embodying cosmic principles of creation and preservation. His worship was central to the early Bhagavata tradition, which emphasized loving devotion and personal relationship with the deity as the source of good fortune and spiritual guidance[1][3][4].

In summary, Narayana originally was:  
- A **non-Vedic tribal god**, especially among Dravidian peoples  
- Known as **Bhagavata**, one who grants fortune and protection to devotees  
- Associated with **water and cosmic resting place**, symbolizing creation and sustenance  
- A figure deeply rooted in ancient tribal and possibly Indus Valley spiritual traditions, predating later assimilations into broader Hindu theology  
- Revered as a **supreme divine authority** who maintained a reciprocal bond with worshippers based on giving fortune and receiving devotion[1][2][3][4][5].

"Starting from the mention of Nārāyaṇa in Vedic texts, we can follow this deity not only to the later Mahābhārata and Harivaṃśa, but also to Nārāyaṇa’s identification with Kṛṣṇa Vāsudeva, the most important deity of the Bhāgavatas. At the same time, the worship of Nārāyaṇa arose as a pillar of the Pāñcarātra tradition, and gradually came to be associated with the emerging Viṣṇuism—in the course of which Nārāyaṇa evolved into a form (and one of the names) of Viṣṇu. But the history of the development of this deity does not come to an end here, however, and leads via various important strands to the traditions of theistic Vedānta, in which the one God Viṣṇu-Nārāyaṇa becomes the centre of theological and philosophical reflection." This is a direct quote from a monograph on Narayana. Please identify all occurences mentioned re: Natayana in the primary literatures. Be exacting please, with which publication, manuscript and recinsion of the text in question to stave ambiguity.

Based on my comprehensive research across multiple sources, I can now provide a detailed analysis of the occurrences of Nārāyaṇa in primary literature with specific manuscript and edition information to address the question with the requested precision.

# Occurrences of Nārāyaṇa in Primary Literature: A Critical Survey

## Vedic Literature

### Ṛgveda
While Nārāyaṇa does not appear explicitly as a name in the earliest layers of the Ṛgveda, the deity appears in later texts that reference Vedic tradition. The **Purusha Sukta** (Ṛgveda 10.90) is fundamental to understanding Nārāyaṇa's development, though the name itself is not present in the original hymn[1][2].

**Manuscript sources**: The Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) houses 30 Ṛgveda manuscripts, including a particularly significant Kashmiri manuscript on birch bark in Śāradā script (No. 5/1875-76)[3]. The critical edition of the Ṛgveda was published by Vaidika Saṃśodhana Maṇḍala, Pune, using BORI's manuscript collection[4].

### Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa
This is where we find some of the earliest explicit references to Nārāyaṇa. The critical passages appear in:

**Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 13.6.1.1**: "*puruṣo ha nārāyaṇo'kāmayata atitiṣṭheyaṃ sarvāṇi bhūtānyahamevedaṃ sarvaṃ syāmiti*" ("Purusha Narayana desired, 'Would that I overpassed all beings! would that I alone were everything here (this universe)!'")[5][6].

**Manuscript editions**: The standard editions include the Mādhyandina recension in 14 kāṇḍas and the Kāṇva recension in 17 kāṇḍas. Julius Eggeling's translation (1882) remains the primary English edition[7][8].

### Taittirīya Tradition
**Taittirīya Saṃhitā**: Contains references to Nārāyaṇa integrated into the ritual context[9].

**Mahānārāyaṇa Upaniṣad**: This exists in multiple recensions:
- **Krishna Yajurveda version**: 64 chapters (South Indian anthologies) and expanded 80-chapter Andhra edition[10][11]
- **Atharvaveda version**: 25 chapters prefixed with *Tripādvibhūti*[10]

**Nārāyaṇa Upaniṣad**: Found as the 10th chapter of Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, also called Mahānārāyaṇa Upaniṣad in some sources[12][13].

## Epic Literature

### Mahābhārata
The epic contains extensive references to Nārāyaṇa throughout its text. Key occurrences include:

**Opening invocation**: "*nārāyaṇaṃ namaskṛtya naraṃ caiva narottamam*" - establishing Nārāyaṇa's primacy from the beginning[14][15].

**Critical edition**: The Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute's critical edition, prepared from 1,259 manuscripts over five decades (1919-1966), remains the definitive scholarly text. This 19-volume edition contains over 89,000 verses[16][17].

**Nārāyaṇīya section**: Located in the Śānti Parva, this provides extensive theological exposition on Nārāyaṇa[18][19].

### Harivaṃśa
Considered the *khilaparvan* (supplementary book) of the Mahābhārata, it contains numerous references to Nārāyaṇa in connection with Kṛṣṇa.

**Critical edition**: BORI published the critical edition in two volumes (1969-1971), edited by P.L. Vaidya, reducing the text from 18,000 to 6,073 ślokas based on manuscript analysis[20][21].

## Pāñcarātra Literature

The Pāñcarātra tradition, fundamental to understanding Nārāyaṇa worship, comprises over 200 texts likely composed between 600-850 CE[22].

**Key manuscripts and texts**:
- **Padma Saṃhitā**: Critical edition based on palm-leaf manuscript D. 5294 from Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Madras[23]
- **Catalogues**: Comprehensive catalogues of Pāñcarātra Saṃhitās identify numerous manuscript sources across Indian collections[24]

## Upaniṣadic Literature

### Aitareya Tradition
While Nārāyaṇa is not explicitly mentioned in the principal Aitareya Upaniṣad, the tradition connects to the broader theological framework through commentaries and related texts[25][26].

**Manuscript evidence**: Cambridge University Library holds a 16th-century manuscript (MS-ADD-02092) containing Śaṅkara's commentary on the Aitareyopaniṣad in an extended nine-book version[26].

## Manuscript Preservation and Critical Editions

### Major Repositories
1. **Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI)**: 29,510 manuscripts, with the Government Manuscript Library containing 17,877 manuscripts[16][27]
2. **Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Madras**
3. **Tanjore Saraswathi Mahal Library**
4. **Nepal collections**: Including the oldest known Purāṇa manuscript (810 CE)[28]

### Dating and Authenticity
The manuscripts containing explicit Nārāyaṇa references generally date from:
- **Earliest**: 9th-10th centuries CE for Purāṇic materials
- **Vedic manuscript tradition**: Oldest surviving Vedic manuscript dates to 1040 CE (Nepal)[29]
- **Critical period**: Most manuscripts containing developed Nārāyaṇa theology date to 11th-16th centuries CE

## Textual Development

The evidence shows Nārāyaṇa's evolution from early Vedic references through Brāhmaṇa literature to full theological development in epic and later Upaniṣadic texts. The critical editions, particularly those by BORI, provide the most reliable textual foundation for understanding this development, having been prepared through rigorous manuscript comparison and scholarly analysis spanning multiple decades.

The manuscript evidence demonstrates that while the concept of Nārāyaṇa has ancient roots in Vedic literature, the explicit theological framework as described in the quoted passage developed primarily during the epic period (roughly 400 BCE - 400 CE) and was further elaborated in Pāñcarātra and later Vaiṣṇava traditions.
