# Purusha Shuktam #


You are wrong: https://indiaphilosophy.wordpress.com/2016/02/25/purusha-suktam-rig-veda-10-90/?utm_source=perplexity

The source you shared indeed presents a traditional view that associates the **Purusha Sukta with Rishi Narayana** (or Maharshi Narayana), specifically mentioning that:

- The commonly used version of the Purusha Sukta contains 24 verses, where the first 18 verses are called **Purvanarayana**, and the last verses as **Uttaranarayana**, which is probably "in honour of Rishi Narayana, the seer of the Purusha Sukta" [1].

- The text explains that the Purusha Sukta is recited very widely in Vedic rituals and often associated with worship of Vishnu or Narayana.

This identification of Narayana as the rishi (seer) of the Purusha Sukta aligns with **a traditional Vaishnava understanding** and certain Puranic references that honor Narayana as the divine seer or author of the hymn.

### What this means in scholarly context:

- While the Rigveda itself does not explicitly name Narayana as the composer of the Purusha Sukta, **later tradition—especially Vaishnava and Puranic—assigns authorship or revelation of the hymn to Maharshi Narayana** as part of theological and devotional interpretation**.

- Some versions or extended recensions of the Purusha Sukta include additional verses (e.g., the Vaishnavanuvaka) which connect more closely with Vishnu-Narayana theology and might reflect later developments or interpolations.

- Scholarly consensus recognizes that parts of the Purusha Sukta were likely added later than the main Rigvedic corpus and show more theistic, cosmic monism themes aligned with theistic Vedanta, which corresponds to the reverence of Narayana as supreme.

### About Maharshi Narayana:

- Maharshi Narayana is traditionally considered a great sage and often identified with the **Supreme Being Vishnu-Narayana** himself or his inspired seer.

- In the Narayana Upanishad and Puranas, Narayana is both divine and the source of revealed knowledge.

- The attribution of the Purusha Sukta to Narayana as rishi derives from theological tradition rather than explicit Vedic corpus evidence.

### Summary

- **Purusha Sukta (Rigveda 10.90) is traditionally linked with Maharshi Narayana as the seer in devotional/Vaishnava sources** and some extended codices of the hymn reflect this.

- This view is part of later theological tradition and interpretive layers rather than strict historical-critical Vedic scholarship, which treats the hymn as compiled anonymously within the Rigveda.

Thus, your referenced source confirms the devotional tradition that the **Purusha Sukta was composed by, or revealed to, Maharshi Narayana**, and this tradition has considerable standing in Indian religious thought.

Is it true that the Rig Vedic Purusha Shuktam was composed by Maharshi Narayana? What do we know of him?

There is **no historical or scriptural evidence that the Rig Vedic Purusha Sukta was composed by Maharshi Narayana**. 

### What the sources tell us about the Purusha Sukta authorship:

- The **Purusha Sukta (Rigveda 10.90)** is part of the tenth mandala of the Rig Veda, which is historically recognized to have been composed by various seers from different families or schools. There is no indication in the Rigveda itself attributing authorship to Maharshi Narayana.

- The tenth mandala, including the Purusha Sukta, is considered a *later* composition relative to the core mandalas (2-7), possibly finalized around the later Vedic period (roughly before 4th century BCE), and is stylistically and linguistically distinct.

- Classical and modern scholars like Max Müller regard the Purusha Sukta as possibly a later addition to the Rigveda, compiled and edited by Veda Vyasa, but authorship remains anonymous or attributed broadly to Rishi families, not a single named figure like Narayana.

- **Maharshi Narayana** is traditionally identified as an ancient seer and sometimes conflated with or associated as original teacher of the *Narayana Upanishad* and some Vaishnava traditions, but no direct source or Vedic hymn credits him specifically with composing the Purusha Sukta.

- The Purusha Sukta, describing cosmic creation and the origin of the varnas, has been extensively commented upon and elaborated in later texts like the Bhagavata Purana and Mahabharata, where the name Narayana becomes significant as a divine principle, but the Rigveda itself does not name him as author.

### Who is Maharshi Narayana?

- Narayana is a **Vedic and Puranic name of the Supreme Being, often equated with Vishnu** in later texts.

- The title "Maharshi Narayana" often refers to the sage in Puranic and Vedantic literature who revealed or expounded specific texts like the Narayana Upanishad.

- In the Vedic corpus, Narayana is more a concept or name of the divine rather than a specific sage credited with hymns.

### Summary

- The **Purusha Sukta is a hymn from Rigveda 10.90 attributed to an unknown seer or seers within the family/school traditions of the Rigveda’s tenth mandala**, not Maharshi Narayana.

- Narayana as a sage or deity figure appears later in Vedic and Puranic literature but is *not historically documented as the composer of the Rig Vedic Purusha Sukta*.

**References for this conclusion:**

- Scholarly analyses of the Rig Veda’s tenth mandala authorship and textual history [2][5][7][8].

- Historical-critical views of hymn interpolations and attributions in the Rig Veda [1][9].

- Descriptions of Narayana as a divine figure distinct from hymn authorship [2][4].

If you want to explore the topic of Narayana as a Vedic or Puranic figure, that can be discussed separately. But the claim that he composed the Rig Vedic Purusha Sukta lacks scriptural or academic support.

Purusha Suktam (Rig Veda 10.90)
The Purusha Sukta is an important part of the Rig-veda (10.7.90.1-16). It also appears in the Taittiriya
Aranyaka (3.12,13), the Vajasaneyi Samhita (31.1-6), the Sama-veda Samhita (6.4), and the Atharva-veda Samhita (19.6). An explanation of
parts of it can also be found in the
Shatapatha Brahman, the Taittiriya Brahmana, and the Shvetashvatara
Upanishad. The Mudgalopanishad
gives a nice summary of the entire Purusha Sukta. The contents of the
Sukta have also been reflected and
elaborated in the Bhagavata Purana
(2.5.35 to 2.6.1-29) and in the
Mahabharata (Mokshadharma Parva
351 and 352). Purusha sukta (puruṣasūkta) is hymn 10.90 of the Rigveda, dedicated to the Purusha, the “Cosmic Being”.
One version of the suktam has 16
verses, 15 in the anushtubh meter, and the final one in the trishtubh meter. Another version of the suktam consists
of 24 verses. The most commonly used Sukta is 24 mantras or
stanzas version. The first 18 mantras are
designated as the Purvanarayana,
and the rest as the Uttaranarayana. This is probably in honour of Rishi Naranayan, the seer of Purush Suktam. Sometimes 6 more mantras are added. This part is called the
Vaishnavanuvaka since it has been
taken from another well known hymn called the Vishnusukta, a part of the
Rig-veda Samhita. Though the
mantras of the Uttaranarayana and the Vaishnavanuvaka do not seem to
have any coherence with the 16
mantras of the Rig-veda Samhita,
tradition has somehow tied them
together. The Purusha Sukta is
a most commonly used Vedic Sanskrit hymn recited in almost all Vedic
rituals and ceremonies. It is often
used during the worship of the Deity of Vishnu or Narayana in the temple,
installation and fire ceremonies, or
during the daily recitation of Sanskrit
literature or for one’s meditation.
The Purusha Sukta is a rather difficult
text to explain in a modern way. This
is primarily because of the archaic
language that does not always lend
itself to interpretations based on the
classical Sanskrit, and that many of the words can be taken in several
different ways, both literally and
symbolically. Nonetheless, the Purusha Sukta gives the essence of the philosophy of
Vedanta, the Vedic tradition, as well
as the Bhagavad-gita and Bhagavata
Purana. It incorporates the principles
of meditation (upasana), knowledge (jnana), devotion (bhakti), and rituals
and duties (dharma and karma).
Content of Purush Sukt
Some scholars are of the view that some verses of Purusha sukta are later interpolations to the Rigveda.[1][2]

The Purusha sukta gives a description
of the spiritual unity of the universe. It
presents the nature of Purusha or the
cosmic being as both immanent in the
manifested world and yet transcendent to it.[3] The sukta holds that From this being, the original creative will (ldentified with Viswakarma, Hiranyagarbha or Prajapati) proceeds and causes the projection of the universe in space and time.[4] The sukta, in the seventh verse,
hints at the organic connectedness of
the various classes of society. The Purusha is defined in verses 2 to 5
of the sukta and described as a being who pervades everything conscious and
unconscious universally. Purush is poetically depicted as a being with thousand
heads, eyes and legs, enveloping the earth from all sides and transcending it
by ten fingers length – or transcending
in all ten directions. It is held that all manifestation,
in past present and future, is the Purusha alone.[3] Sukt also proclaims that Purush transcends his
creation. Finally, his glory is held to be even greater than
the portrayal in this sukta. Creation Verses 5-15 hold the creation of the Rig Veda. Creation is described to have started with the origination of Virat or
the cosmic body from the Purusha. In
Virat, omnipresent intelligence
manifests itself which causes the
appearance of diversity. In the verses
following, it is held that Purusha through a sacrifice of himself, brings
forth the avian, forest-dwelling and
domestic animals, the three Vedas, the metres (of the mantras). Then follows a verse which states that from his mouth,
arms, thighs, feet the four Varnas (classes) are born. This four varna-related verse is controversial and is
believed by many scholars, such as Max Müller, to be a corruption and a medieval or modern era insertion into the text.[1][2] After the verse, the sukta states that
the moon takes birth from the
Purusha’s mind and the sun from his
eyes. Indra and Agni descend from his mouth and from his vital breath, air is
born. The firmament comes from his
navel, the heavens from his head, the
earth from his feet and quarters of space from his ears.[3] Through this creation, underlying unity of human,
cosmic and divine realities is espoused,
for all are seen arising out of same original reality, the Purusha.[5]

Yajna The Purusha sukta holds that the world
is created by and out of a Yajna or sacrifice of the Purusha. All forms of
existence are held to be grounded in
this primordial Yajna. In the seventeenth verse, the concept of Yajna
itself is held to have arisen out of this
original sacrifice. In the final verses,
Yajna is extolled as the primordial energy ground for all existence.[6]
The sukta gives an expression to
immanence of radical unity in diversity
and is therefore, seen as the
foundation of the Vaishnava thought, Bhedabheda school of philosophy and Bhagavata theology.[7] The concept of the Purusha is from the
Samkhya Philosophy which is traced to
the Indus Valley period. It seems to be
an interpolation into the Rig veda since
it is out of character with the other hymns dedicated to nature gods.[8] The Purusha sukta is repeated with
some variations in the Atharva Veda (19.6). Sections of it also occur in the Panchavimsha Brahmana, Vajasaneyi Samhita and the Taittiriya Aranyaka.[9] Among Puranic texts, the sukta has been elaborated in the Bhagavata Purana (2.5.35 to 2.6.1-29) and in the Mahabharata (Mokshadharma Parva 351 and 352
Regarding authenticity of Purusha Sukta, many 19th and early 20th century
western scholars questioned as to
when parts or all of Purusha Sukta were
composed, and whether some of these
verses were present in the ancient
version of Rigveda. They suggest it was interpolated in post-Vedic era,[10] and is a relatively modern origin of Purusha Sukta.[1][2] B. V. Kamesvara Aiyar, another 19th
century scholar, on the other hand, disputed this idea:[15]
The Purusha Sukta varna verse is now
generally considered to have been
inserted at a later date into the Vedic text, possibly as a charter myth.[16] Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton, a
professor of Sanskrit and Religious
studies, state, “there is no evidence in
the Rigveda for an elaborate, much-
subdivided and overarching caste
system”, and “the varna system seems to be embryonic in the Rigveda and,
both then and later, a social ideal rather than a social reality”.[16]

Concept of Purush in Indian tradition
Purusha is an extremely complex concept whose meaning has
evolved in Vedic and Upanishadic times. Its meaning and interpretation has depended on the source and
historical timeline. It may variously mean the cosmic
man, the Self, Consciousness and Universal principle.[1][2][3] In early Vedas, Purusa appears to mean a cosmic
man whose sacrifice by the gods created all life.[4] This was one of many creation theories discussed in the Vedas. The idea parallels Norse Ymir,[5] with the myth’s origin in Proto-Indo- European religion.[6] In the Upanishads, the Purusa concept
no longer meant a being or cosmic
man and its meaning evolved to an
abstract essence of Self, Spirit and the
Universal Principle that is eternal,
indestructible, without form and all pervasive.[4] The view of the immanence of the
Purusha in manifestation and yet his
transcendence of it is described in the sukt is similar to the
viewpoint held by panentheists. The Purusa concept is explained with the concept of Prakrti in
the Upanishads. The universe is
envisioned, in these ancient Sanskrit
texts, as a combination of perceivable
material reality and non-perceivable,
non-material laws and principles of nature.[3][7] Material reality, or Prakrti, is everything that has changed, can
change and is subject to cause and
effect. Purusa is the Universal principle
that is unchanging, uncaused but is
present everywhere and the reason why
Prakrti changes, evolves all the time and why there is cause and effect.[7]

Purusa is what connects everything and
everyone, according to various schools
of Hinduism. However, there is a great diversity of views within
various schools of Hinduism about the
definition, scope and nature of Purusa. [2]
Definition and description of Purusha being a complex concept, its
meaning evolved over time in the
philosophical traditions of
Hinduism as well. During the Vedic period,
Purusa concept was one of several
theories offered for the creation of universe.[8] Purusa, in Rigveda, was described as a being, who becomes a
sacrificial victim of gods, and whose
sacrifice creates all life forms including human beings.[4] In the Upanishads and later texts of
Hindu philosophy, the Purusa concept
moved away from the Vedic definition
of Purusa. The
concept flowered into a more complex abstraction.[9] Both Samkhya[11] and Yoga schools of Hinduism state that there are two
ultimate realities whose interaction
accounts for all experiences and
universe – Prakrti (matter) and Purusa (spirit).[3][12] In other words, the universe is envisioned as a combination
of perceivable material reality and non-
perceivable, non-material laws and
principles of nature. Material reality, or
Prakrti, is everything that has changed,
can change and is subject to cause and effect. Universal principle, or Purusa, is that which is unchanging (aksara)[2] and is uncaused. The animating causes,
fields and principles of nature is Purusa
in Hindu philosophy. Hinduism refers to
Purusa as the soul of the universe, the
universal spirit present everywhere, in
everything and everyone, all the times. Purusa is Universal Principle that is
eternal, indestructible, without form
and all pervasive. It is Purusa in the
form of natures laws and principles
that operate in the background to
regulate, guide and direct change, evolution, cause and effect.[3] It is Purusa, in Hindu concept of existence,
that breathes life into matter, is the source of all consciousness,[2] one that creates oneness in all life forms, in all
of humanity, and the essence of Self. It
is Purusa, according to Hinduism, why
the universe operates, is dynamic and evolves, as against being static.[7] 

Both Samkhya and Yoga school holds
that the path to moksha (release, Self-
realization) includes the realization of Purusha.[13]
The abstract idea Purusa is extensively
discussed in various Upanishads, and
referred interchangeably as maha-
atman and brahman (not to be confused with Brahmin).[2] Sutra literature refers to a similar concept using the word puṃs. Rishi Angiras of the Atmopanishad belonging to the Atharvaveda explains that Purusha, the dweller in the body, is
three-fold: the Bahyatman (the Outer-
Atman) which is born and dies; the
Antaratman (the Inner-Atman) which
comprehends the whole range of
material phenomena, gross and subtle, with which the Jiva concerns himself, and the Paramatman which is all- pervading, unthinkable, indescribable,
is without action and has no Samskaras.[14] The Vedanta Sutras state janmādy asya yatah, meaning that ‘The Absolute
Truth is that from which everything else
emanates’ Bhagavata Purana [S.1.1.1].
For the theistic schools of Hinduism, there is no consensus among various these schools of
Hinduism on the definition of Purusa,
and it is left to each school and
individual to reach their own
conclusions. For example, one of many
theistic traditions script such as Kapilasurisamvada, credited to another
ancient Hindu philosopher named
Kapila, first describes purusa in a
manner similar to Samkhya-Yoga
schools above, but then proceeds to
describe buddhi (intellect) as second purusa, and ahamkara (ego) as third
purusa. Such pluralism and diversity of thought within Hinduism [15] implies that the term purusa is a complex term
with diverse meanings.
As for the Rigvedic justification of Varna system in Hindu society, in one verse of Purusha sukta (10:90.11), Varna is portrayed as a result of human beings
created from different parts of the
body of the divinity Purusha. This
Purusha Sukta verse is controversial
and is believed by many scholars, such
as Max Müller, to be a corruption and medieval or modern era insertion into Veda,[16][17] because unlike all other major concepts in the Vedas including those of Purusha,[18] the four varnas are never mentioned anywhere else in
any of the Vedas, and because this
verse is missing in some manuscript
prints found in different parts of India.
