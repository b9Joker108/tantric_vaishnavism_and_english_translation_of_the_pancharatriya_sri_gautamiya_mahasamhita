# Purusha Shuktam #


You are wrong: https://indiaphilosophy.wordpress.com/2016/02/25/purusha-suktam-rig-veda-10-90/?utm_source=perplexity

The source you shared indeed presents a traditional view that associates the **Purusha Sukta with Rishi Narayana** (or Maharshi Narayana), specifically mentioning that:

- The commonly used version of the Purusha Sukta contains 24 verses, where the first 18 verses are called **Purvanarayana**, and the last verses as **Uttaranarayana**, which is probably "in honour of Rishi Narayana, the seer of the Purusha Sukta" [1].

- The text explains that the Purusha Sukta is recited very widely in Vedic rituals and often associated with worship of Vishnu or Narayana.

This identification of Narayana as the rishi (seer) of the Purusha Sukta aligns with **a traditional Vaishnava understanding** and certain Puranic references that honor Narayana as the divine seer or author of the hymn.

### What this means in scholarly context:

- While the Rigveda itself does not explicitly name Narayana as the composer of the Purusha Sukta, **later tradition—especially Vaishnava and Puranic—assigns authorship or revelation of the hymn to Maharshi Narayana** as part of theological and devotional interpretation**.

- Some versions or extended recensions of the Purusha Sukta include additional verses (e.g., the Vaishnavanuvaka) which connect more closely with Vishnu-Narayana theology and might reflect later developments or interpolations.

- Scholarly consensus recognizes that parts of the Purusha Sukta were likely added later than the main Rigvedic corpus and show more theistic, cosmic monism themes aligned with theistic Vedanta, which corresponds to the reverence of Narayana as supreme.

### About Maharshi Narayana:

- Maharshi Narayana is traditionally considered a great sage and often identified with the **Supreme Being Vishnu-Narayana** himself or his inspired seer.

- In the Narayana Upanishad and Puranas, Narayana is both divine and the source of revealed knowledge.

- The attribution of the Purusha Sukta to Narayana as rishi derives from theological tradition rather than explicit Vedic corpus evidence.

### Summary

- **Purusha Sukta (Rigveda 10.90) is traditionally linked with Maharshi Narayana as the seer in devotional/Vaishnava sources** and some extended codices of the hymn reflect this.

- This view is part of later theological tradition and interpretive layers rather than strict historical-critical Vedic scholarship, which treats the hymn as compiled anonymously within the Rigveda.

Thus, your referenced source confirms the devotional tradition that the **Purusha Sukta was composed by, or revealed to, Maharshi Narayana**, and this tradition has considerable standing in Indian religious thought.

Is it true that the Rig Vedic Purusha Shuktam was composed by Maharshi Narayana? What do we know of him?

There is **no historical or scriptural evidence that the Rig Vedic Purusha Sukta was composed by Maharshi Narayana**. 

### What the sources tell us about the Purusha Sukta authorship:

- The **Purusha Sukta (Rigveda 10.90)** is part of the tenth mandala of the Rig Veda, which is historically recognized to have been composed by various seers from different families or schools. There is no indication in the Rigveda itself attributing authorship to Maharshi Narayana.

- The tenth mandala, including the Purusha Sukta, is considered a *later* composition relative to the core mandalas (2-7), possibly finalized around the later Vedic period (roughly before 4th century BCE), and is stylistically and linguistically distinct.

- Classical and modern scholars like Max Müller regard the Purusha Sukta as possibly a later addition to the Rigveda, compiled and edited by Veda Vyasa, but authorship remains anonymous or attributed broadly to Rishi families, not a single named figure like Narayana.

- **Maharshi Narayana** is traditionally identified as an ancient seer and sometimes conflated with or associated as original teacher of the *Narayana Upanishad* and some Vaishnava traditions, but no direct source or Vedic hymn credits him specifically with composing the Purusha Sukta.

- The Purusha Sukta, describing cosmic creation and the origin of the varnas, has been extensively commented upon and elaborated in later texts like the Bhagavata Purana and Mahabharata, where the name Narayana becomes significant as a divine principle, but the Rigveda itself does not name him as author.

### Who is Maharshi Narayana?

- Narayana is a **Vedic and Puranic name of the Supreme Being, often equated with Vishnu** in later texts.

- The title "Maharshi Narayana" often refers to the sage in Puranic and Vedantic literature who revealed or expounded specific texts like the Narayana Upanishad.

- In the Vedic corpus, Narayana is more a concept or name of the divine rather than a specific sage credited with hymns.

### Summary

- The **Purusha Sukta is a hymn from Rigveda 10.90 attributed to an unknown seer or seers within the family/school traditions of the Rigveda’s tenth mandala**, not Maharshi Narayana.

- Narayana as a sage or deity figure appears later in Vedic and Puranic literature but is *not historically documented as the composer of the Rig Vedic Purusha Sukta*.

**References for this conclusion:**

- Scholarly analyses of the Rig Veda’s tenth mandala authorship and textual history [2][5][7][8].

- Historical-critical views of hymn interpolations and attributions in the Rig Veda [1][9].

- Descriptions of Narayana as a divine figure distinct from hymn authorship [2][4].

If you want to explore the topic of Narayana as a Vedic or Puranic figure, that can be discussed separately. But the claim that he composed the Rig Vedic Purusha Sukta lacks scriptural or academic support.
