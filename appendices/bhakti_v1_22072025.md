# Bhakti #

NB: This appendix is my endeavour to grapple with the complexes and continua and originations, developments and disseminations, of what is technically and popularly termed bhakti. I will also problematise the indiscriminate usage of "Bhakti movement" unqualified. I will also endeavour to convey the entwinement and continua and mutual iteration of the Bhakti, Tantra (Agamic older) and Sahajiya (post c. 8th century younger) worldviews, with the Samkya-Yoga Darshan continuüm and their stock transpersonal architectures as evident in their mystico-magical-ritual praxes.

My interest is in the canonical origins of popular Bhakti and which of the Shaiva Nayanars or Vaishnava Alvars demonstrate the first attested Acharya? Also, the Vaikhanasa and Pancharatra in their early Late Vedic evocations, clearly had a developmed form of Bhakti, long before this. Also, the cults of ancient extra-Vedic Village Goddesses and cults of Nagas and in particular Yakshas and Holy Trees and sacred groves and sacred stones, clearly evince many aspects of what is conceived technically by the term Bhakti. Even the hymns of the Rig Veda demonstrate Bhakti. So, I am very confused that the Origins of Bhakti are canonically tied to the early mediaeval period of South India.

## **The Complex Origins of Bhakti: Beyond Medieval South India**

Your confusion about the canonical origins of Bhakti being tied exclusively to early medieval South India is entirely justified. The scholarly evidence reveals a much more complex and ancient history of devotional practices that extends far beyond the Nayanars and Alvars, though their contributions were undeniably significant.

### **Early Attestations of Bhakti**

The earliest textual evidence for bhakti as a concept appears much earlier than the medieval Tamil saints. The **Shvetashvatara Upanishad** (dated between 6th-5th century BCE by Paul Muller-Ortega) contains the first occurrence of the word *bhakti*[1][2]. The term derives from the Sanskrit root *bhaj*, meaning "to revere," "to share," "to partake," and "to worship"[1][3]. 

Even earlier, **Panini** (c. 500 BCE) mentions *bhakti* in reference to Vasudeva, Krishna's father[4][5]. The **Rig Veda** itself demonstrates devotional attitudes, as noted by traditional commentator Sayana, who interprets the terms *bhaktam* and *a-bhaktam* as *sevamana* and *a-sevanamana* (those who serve and those who do not)[6].

### **The Bhagavad Gita's Role**

The **Bhagavad Gita** (dated to 2nd-1st century BCE) developed bhakti as "an alternative to the paths of canonical wisdom and ascetical austerities"[7]. Its 12th chapter, titled "Bhakti Yoga," presents devotion as a complete spiritual path[8]. However, scholarly analysis suggests the Gita represents a synthesis of earlier devotional traditions rather than their origin[9].

### **Vaikhanasa and Pancharatra Traditions**

Your observation about the **Vaikhanasa** and **Pancharatra** traditions is crucial. The Vaikhanasas originated as forest-dwelling ascetics mentioned in the **Manava Dharmashastra** before the common era, with references in the **Narayaniyam** section of the Mahabharata (possibly 3rd century CE or earlier)[10]. They claim direct Vedic origins and maintain that their temple worship is a continuation of Vedic *yajna*[11][12].

The **Pancharatra** movement originated in late 3rd-century BCE around ideas of Narayana and Vishnu's various avatars[13]. By the 2nd century BCE, Greek ambassador Megasthenes reported worship of Krishna as an incarnation of Vishnu[4][5]. These traditions developed sophisticated devotional theologies centuries before the Tamil saints.

### **Pre-Vedic and Folk Devotional Practices**

Your reference to village goddesses, Naga and Yaksha cults, sacred groves, and stone worship is particularly astute. The **village goddess tradition** predates Indo-Aryan arrival, with roots potentially extending to the Indus Valley Civilization's mother goddess imagery[14]. These deities were "worshipped with more intensity than Hindu Gods"[15] and represented forms of devotional engagement that clearly evince "many aspects of what is conceived technically by the term Bhakti."

**Yaksha worship** dates to the pre-Vedic period and involved "territorial fertility deities" who, if properly worshipped, could guarantee abundance through their control over water and fertility[16]. The **Matsya Purana** describes how Yaksha worship was eventually assimilated into Shaivism rather than being violently eradicated[17].

**Sacred groves** represent ancient traditions where "gods, goddesses, spirits are believed to reside," with worship practices that predate classical temple religion[18]. The Tamil tradition of **Sangam literature** (6th century BCE - 3rd century CE) contains references to devotional practices at sacred sites[19].

### **Scholarly Perspectives on Dating Issues**

Klaus Witz traces "the history and nature of the Bhakti movement to the Upanishadic and the Vedanta foundations of Hinduism," noting that "in virtually every Bhakti movement poet, the Upanishadic teachings form an all-pervasive substratum"[20][21]. This suggests continuity rather than medieval innovation.

Contemporary scholarship recognizes that "some scholars question whether the Bhakti movement ever was a reform or rebellion of any kind. They suggest the Bhakti movement was a revival, reworking, and recontextualisation of ancient Vedic traditions"[20].

### **The Tamil Saints' Historical Significance**

The **Nayanars** (6th-8th centuries CE) and **Alvars** (traditionally dated to various periods, with scholarly consensus around 5th-9th centuries CE) were indeed transformative[22][23]. The earliest Nayanar, **Karaikkal Ammaiyar**, lived in the 6th century[24]. Among the Alvars, the first three—**Poigai, Bhoothath, and Pey Alvars**—are traditionally considered the earliest[25].

However, their significance lies not in originating bhakti but in **democratizing and intensifying** existing devotional traditions. They composed in Tamil rather than Sanskrit, made devotion accessible across caste lines, and created extensive poetic literatures that became canonical texts[26][7].

### **Resolving the Canonical Confusion**

The confusion arises from several factors:

1. **Colonial periodization** that emphasized medieval developments over ancient continuities
2. **Textual preservation** favoring later, more organized literary traditions
3. **Scholarly focus** on institutional bhakti rather than folk devotional practices
4. **Regional emphasis** on Tamil literary achievements rather than pan-Indian devotional patterns

Your observation about bhakti elements in Rig Vedic hymns, Vaikhanasa-Pancharatra traditions, and folk practices is entirely correct. The Tamil saints represented a **crystallization and popularization** of much older devotional currents rather than their origin. As one scholar notes, "Bhakti poetry and ideas" spread "throughout India by the 12th–18th century CE" from Tamil Nadu, but this was a **dissemination of intensified forms** of existing traditions, not the birth of devotion itself[20].

The canonical dating to early medieval South India reflects the period when bhakti became a **systematic literary and theological movement**, but the devotional impulse itself has much deeper and more diverse roots in Indian religious history.
