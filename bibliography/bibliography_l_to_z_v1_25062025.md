Four-armed Shrimati Sarasvati (c. 10th - 11th century), image by The Walters Art Museum, with a (cc) Creative Commons Licence. Carved from soapstone native to Uttar Pradesh, Northern India, where the sculpture was also initially sited. Sculpture dimensions sans base: height: 71.2 cm; width: 55.6 cm; depth: 24.4 cm. Acquired in Varanasi (?), India, in 1969 by The Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, Maryland, U. S. A. The Goddess of Music, Learning and the Arts, plucks the Veena, a stringed musical instrument, whilst holding a palm leaf manuscript in Her left rear hand, which rests on the calve of Her left leg. The divine attribute of the Manuscript, alludes to Her domain of Knowledge, particularly Sacred Knowledge, which the goddess guards and protects. Maa Saraswathi is worshipped pervasively throughout the Dharmic Traditions, within the Sanatana Dharma (Hindus), Jaina Dharma and Buddhists Dharma traditions, amongst others, all of which worship Sarasvati, having adapted Her from earlier Animist traditions, which held that all natural objects are sentient and enspirited and have a spiritual nature or essence. Sarasvathi, takes Her name from a formerly significant river in India, that once flower all the way to the coast (now largely dry, though flows intermittently, post-deluge). Maa Sarasvati is an ancient riverine deity, who personifies the abundant gifts and bounty bestowed by the river, not least of which was the provision of life-giving water to support life in the region, and also the provision of invaluable irrigation for crops and livestock. Legends of Her beneficence extended to Her bestowal of Knowledge, the Divine Word (from Sri Vac Devi, with whom She synchronised), and Sound, to humankind, especially amongst later Sanatana Dharma (Hindu) traditions. ‡•ê ‡§π‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§ê‡§Ç ‡§π‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡•ê ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à ‡§®‡§Æ‡§É ||

# Annotated Bibliography (3B: L - Z) of the English translation of the 'Gautamiya Samhita' or 'Gautamiya Mahatantram', a Vaishnava Tantric Pancharatra Agama, with extensive Frontmatter & Introduction #

by Sri Nagahari-dasa a.k.a. Beauford A. Stenberg

**Note:** The (1A & 1B): Frontmatter and extensive Introduction and Survey-of-the- Field the (2A & 2B): Sanskrit original and Hindi commentary, along with annotations, English translation, analysis and commentary, will be complemented by (3A: A‚Ää-‚ÄäK & 3B: L -Z): this Annotated Bibliography. All three (3) will be progressively and incrementally published in Medium separately, as complimentary living documents, due to publication number-of-word restrictions per published page, according to Medium (online) Webmaster's site policy and the electronic medium, proper. I may also institute (4): An Index of sorts, to collectively house a Table-of-Contents (TOC), and hypertext linkages, to assist ease of electronic navigation and wayfinding, for my audience. I have resolved not to place this work behind a paywall. That said, I reserve the right to review that determination in future, once the work has been well-progressed and well onway to realisation.

This item is the fourth of five volumes of a suite. The first volume of which, is my principal secondary resource. It took me circa three (3) weeks of solid work of protracted research and endeavour to realise it. It was not been cited in any work I have so far read. The first volume out of five (5), is effectively a monograph on the Pancharatra as a class. It is the first substantive monographic work on the topic in English, that I have secured. As such, I cherish it greatly as my guiding light and I am actually unwrapping it ever-so-slowly, savouring and integrating each sip of the nectarine elixir and fully digesting it, before progressing. Actually, before fully progressing my study of this work and progressing with the Gautamiya Mahatantram translation, I have somewhat been seduced into translating an emic Hindi work on Vaishnava Tantra, geared towards academically oriented to the cohort of the young adult Vaishnava, but is of course useful for those outside this cohort, as an entry into the topic, and the doctrine and sadhana proper, which it treates. I actually anticipate, that I will progress the translations incrementally in tandem. NB: Beauford, reference and file the other four (4) volumes.

As soon as I saw "sƒÅttƒÅda", my intuition told me it was a Romanised Tamilization with diacritics, of the Sanskrit "sƒÅtvata" or "sƒÅttvata". On reading the article, Lester surrenders this point, but only in passing.

This work is definitely informed by the vast amount of work and citations, I uploaded and published in English Wikipedia, from a number of articles, but particularly the now renamed and defunct English Wikipedia article that I inaugurated, populated and cited, and named 'Kƒ´lƒÅ (Sanskrit)', later changed by others to 'Buddhism', which I disagreed with. Even Boord personally contributed to the article, amongst other Tibetologists and Sanskritists. This dissertation even utilises some of my specific terms of phrase, unattributed. My writing and referencing style is idiosyncratic and distinctive. Especially, when my writing is decidedly polished, through much toil. I consider myself a jeweller. I write, often spontaneously. Then, slowly, meticulously, painstakingly and methodologically: facet, filigree, and fashion cabochons and cameos of concept and language. I find it annoying and disconcerting, that some scholars, such as Li, feel they do not need to cite Wikipedia, when their work has drawn and benefited extensively from it. I feel, and it is my concerted opinion, that the time has long since passed when Academia and the bastions of scholarship, could deprecate and disparage the contribution of the suite of Wikimedia projects, and all those (mostly) anonymous, selfless, contributions, of mostly non-academically trained, non-professionals, to iterate and inform global discourse, knowledge and information dissemination, and the subsequent leavening of the global scholarship of Academia and institutional pedagogy and traditions of scholarship. The Wikimedia projects and their synthesis and showcase of human knowledges and discourse confluence, has profoundly altered the 'Human Condition' and 'The Spirit of the Age', since its inception. Well, this position, I tender, proffer and defend.

"This dissertation deals with the PƒÅdmasamhitƒÅ (PƒÅdS), a Sanskrit work of South Indian origin, belonging to the PƒÅ√±carƒÅtra, composed between the XII and XIII century A. D.. Information about the period and features of composition of the work, its structure and contents is given in the Introduction of the dissertation; methodological issues and the chief results of the research are also therein discussed. The first part is devoted to philosophical and theological teachings of the PƒÅdS. The chapter on the doctrine of God deals with the concept of the threefold manifestation (i.e. the Highest VƒÅsudeva, puru≈üa and prak≈óti) of the Supreme Being, which is influenced by YƒÅdavaprakƒÅ≈õa's idea of the unfolding of brahman in its three manifestations (a≈Ü≈õa); the relational aspect of the godhead, concretized in the presence of God in meditation and ritual worship, is elucidated. The chapter on the individual soul deals with the origination of the jƒ´va-s, their involvement in sa≈ÜsƒÅra and their striving after emancipation. The chapter on the doctrine of liberation illustrates both the concept of mukti as union between individual souls and Supreme Soul, and the idea of a fourfold liberation. The second part is devoted to yoga. The first two chapters discuss problems concerning the text and structure of the yogapƒÅda and reassess the idea of the "limbs" of yoga. In the third and fourth chapter some elements of subtle physiology, together with certain psycho-physical practices of the yogin are illustrated. The last chapter, devoted to the religious dimension of yoga, discusses the following: the function of the yogic disciplines in the yoga-permeated ritual system of the PƒÅdS; the importance of yogic meditation (dhyƒÅna) in religious life and spiritual experiences of the devotee; the ritual practice of yogic suicide as a means of hastening final emancipation."
