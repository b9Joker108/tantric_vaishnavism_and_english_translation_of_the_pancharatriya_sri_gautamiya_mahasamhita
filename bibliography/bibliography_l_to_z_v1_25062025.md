Four-armed Shrimati Sarasvati (c. 10th - 11th century), image by The Walters Art Museum, with a (cc) Creative Commons Licence. Carved from soapstone native to Uttar Pradesh, Northern India, where the sculpture was also initially sited. Sculpture dimensions sans base: height: 71.2 cm; width: 55.6 cm; depth: 24.4 cm. Acquired in Varanasi (?), India, in 1969 by The Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, Maryland, U. S. A. The Goddess of Music, Learning and the Arts, plucks the Veena, a stringed musical instrument, whilst holding a palm leaf manuscript in Her left rear hand, which rests on the calve of Her left leg. The divine attribute of the Manuscript, alludes to Her domain of Knowledge, particularly Sacred Knowledge, which the goddess guards and protects. Maa Saraswathi is worshipped pervasively throughout the Dharmic Traditions, within the Sanatana Dharma (Hindus), Jaina Dharma and Buddhists Dharma traditions, amongst others, all of which worship Sarasvati, having adapted Her from earlier Animist traditions, which held that all natural objects are sentient and enspirited and have a spiritual nature or essence. Sarasvathi, takes Her name from a formerly significant river in India, that once flower all the way to the coast (now largely dry, though flows intermittently, post-deluge). Maa Sarasvati is an ancient riverine deity, who personifies the abundant gifts and bounty bestowed by the river, not least of which was the provision of life-giving water to support life in the region, and also the provision of invaluable irrigation for crops and livestock. Legends of Her beneficence extended to Her bestowal of Knowledge, the Divine Word (from Sri Vac Devi, with whom She synchronised), and Sound, to humankind, especially amongst later Sanatana Dharma (Hindu) traditions. ‡•ê ‡§π‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§ê‡§Ç ‡§π‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡•ê ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à ‡§®‡§Æ‡§É ||

# Annotated Bibliography (3B: L - Z) of the English translation of the 'Gautamiya Samhita' or 'Gautamiya Mahatantram', a Vaishnava Tantric Pancharatra Agama, with extensive Frontmatter & Introduction #

by Sri Nagahari-dasa a.k.a. Beauford A. Stenberg

**Note:** The (1A & 1B): Frontmatter and extensive Introduction and Survey-of-the- Field the (2A & 2B): Sanskrit original and Hindi commentary, along with annotations, English translation, analysis and commentary, will be complemented by (3A: A‚Ää-‚ÄäK & 3B: L -Z): this Annotated Bibliography. All three (3) will be progressively and incrementally published in Medium separately, as complimentary living documents, due to publication number-of-word restrictions per published page, according to Medium (online) Webmaster's site policy and the electronic medium, proper. I may also institute (4): An Index of sorts, to collectively house a Table-of-Contents (TOC), and hypertext linkages, to assist ease of electronic navigation and wayfinding, for my audience. I have resolved not to place this work behind a paywall. That said, I reserve the right to review that determination in future, once the work has been well-progressed and well onway to realisation.

This item is the fourth of five volumes of a suite. The first volume of which, is my principal secondary resource. It took me circa three (3) weeks of solid work of protracted research and endeavour to realise it. It was not been cited in any work I have so far read. The first volume out of five (5), is effectively a monograph on the Pancharatra as a class. It is the first substantive monographic work on the topic in English, that I have secured. As such, I cherish it greatly as my guiding light and I am actually unwrapping it ever-so-slowly, savouring and integrating each sip of the nectarine elixir and fully digesting it, before progressing. Actually, before fully progressing my study of this work and progressing with the Gautamiya Mahatantram translation, I have somewhat been seduced into translating an emic Hindi work on Vaishnava Tantra, geared towards academically oriented to the cohort of the young adult Vaishnava, but is of course useful for those outside this cohort, as an entry into the topic, and the doctrine and sadhana proper, which it treates. I actually anticipate, that I will progress the translations incrementally in tandem. NB: Beauford, reference and file the other four (4) volumes.

As soon as I saw "sƒÅttƒÅda", my intuition told me it was a Romanised Tamilization with diacritics, of the Sanskrit "sƒÅtvata" or "sƒÅttvata". On reading the article, Lester surrenders this point, but only in passing.

This work is definitely informed by the vast amount of work and citations, I uploaded and published in English Wikipedia, from a number of articles, but particularly the now renamed and defunct English Wikipedia article that I inaugurated, populated and cited, and named 'Kƒ´lƒÅ (Sanskrit)', later changed by others to 'Buddhism', which I disagreed with. Even Boord personally contributed to the article, amongst other Tibetologists and Sanskritists. This dissertation even utilises some of my specific terms of phrase, unattributed. My writing and referencing style is idiosyncratic and distinctive. Especially, when my writing is decidedly polished, through much toil. I consider myself a jeweller. I write, often spontaneously. Then, slowly, meticulously, painstakingly and methodologically: facet, filigree, and fashion cabochons and cameos of concept and language. I find it annoying and disconcerting, that some scholars, such as Li, feel they do not need to cite Wikipedia, when their work has drawn and benefited extensively from it. I feel, and it is my concerted opinion, that the time has long since passed when Academia and the bastions of scholarship, could deprecate and disparage the contribution of the suite of Wikimedia projects, and all those (mostly) anonymous, selfless, contributions, of mostly non-academically trained, non-professionals, to iterate and inform global discourse, knowledge and information dissemination, and the subsequent leavening of the global scholarship of Academia and institutional pedagogy and traditions of scholarship. The Wikimedia projects and their synthesis and showcase of human knowledges and discourse confluence, has profoundly altered the 'Human Condition' and 'The Spirit of the Age', since its inception. Well, this position, I tender, proffer and defend.

"This dissertation deals with the PƒÅdmasamhitƒÅ (PƒÅdS), a Sanskrit work of South Indian origin, belonging to the PƒÅ√±carƒÅtra, composed between the XII and XIII century A. D.. Information about the period and features of composition of the work, its structure and contents is given in the Introduction of the dissertation; methodological issues and the chief results of the research are also therein discussed. The first part is devoted to philosophical and theological teachings of the PƒÅdS. The chapter on the doctrine of God deals with the concept of the threefold manifestation (i.e. the Highest VƒÅsudeva, puru≈üa and prak≈óti) of the Supreme Being, which is influenced by YƒÅdavaprakƒÅ≈õa's idea of the unfolding of brahman in its three manifestations (a≈Ü≈õa); the relational aspect of the godhead, concretized in the presence of God in meditation and ritual worship, is elucidated. The chapter on the individual soul deals with the origination of the jƒ´va-s, their involvement in sa≈ÜsƒÅra and their striving after emancipation. The chapter on the doctrine of liberation illustrates both the concept of mukti as union between individual souls and Supreme Soul, and the idea of a fourfold liberation. The second part is devoted to yoga. The first two chapters discuss problems concerning the text and structure of the yogapƒÅda and reassess the idea of the "limbs" of yoga. In the third and fourth chapter some elements of subtle physiology, together with certain psycho-physical practices of the yogin are illustrated. The last chapter, devoted to the religious dimension of yoga, discusses the following: the function of the yogic disciplines in the yoga-permeated ritual system of the PƒÅdS; the importance of yogic meditation (dhyƒÅna) in religious life and spiritual experiences of the devotee; the ritual practice of yogic suicide as a means of hastening final emancipation."

The commentator Srikantha (Sanskrit: ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§ï‡§£‡•ç‡§† ‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø¬†; IAST: ≈örƒ´ka·πá·π≠ha ≈öivƒÅcƒÅrya, alternately Sanskrit: ‡§®‡•Ä‡§≤‡§ï‡§£‡•ç‡§† ‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§Ø¬†; Nƒ´laka·πá·π≠ha ≈öivƒÅcƒÅrya) upholds the Shaiva Vishishtadvaita Siddhanta. As per Ramesan (1972: p. 67), we do not know whether Srikantha flourished before or after Ramanuja. Subramuniyaswami (2004, 1998: p. 843) gives the uncited date of circa 1050 CE for Srikantha and that would make him contemporaneous with Ramanuja and then states that the Shaiva Vishishtadvaita was "Patterned after the Vaish·πáavite Vi≈õish·π≠ƒÅdvaita of Ramanuja, this philosophy was later amplified by Appaya Dikshitar.". Duquette (2021: p. 2), after providing details of a number of scholarly works that treat Srikantha and his dates, compositions and commentaries, states that he flourished circa 14th‚Ää-‚Ää15th centuries, so well post-Ramanuja.

This is the edition that first gave the Pancharatriya agamaic Sri Gautamiya Samhita, that I am giving extended attention and treatment to, the appelation "Mahatantram". I sourced and secured this edited text of the principal root scripture of this endeavour as per date accessed, as abovecited. The work does not expressly state it is critically edited, only edited. Given its provenance, that is enough to make this volume, my principal primary resource, for this endeavour. That this work is edited by scholars of an ancient city in Mahabharata Varsha, by Shastri Malaviya, Doctor, Professor and Head of the Samhya-Yoga-Tantra-Agama-Departent, of the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, Kashi (Varanasi), and ornamented with a generous Foreward in Sanskrit by Dr. Vidyaniwas Misra, Vice-Chancellor, of Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, it is almost unnecessary for it to be expressly stated, but I feel it obligatory, to convey, as follows, in emphasis. The urbanity of Kashi is demonstrably ancient and an esteemed seat of dedicated learning since at least the early medi√¶val era, as known to Western scholarship. But, it may be properly, technically, an ancient, dedicated and uninterruped seat of learning in Great Mother India, since time immemorial. Much, is not recorded in English, nor indeed, in any Western or European language. Their collective private treasury of published and unpublished manuscripts and volumes, including rarities and the rarefied, would be immeasurable, as would their traditional cum modernised mentoring and initiatory systems and reticlum of secret societies and established networks. In addition to what has been aforestated, their interior treasury of secret and reserved volumes and manuscripts, mostly unpublished and many uncatalogued, at least for the Western gaze, must be vast. I tender, many Indic manuscripts held to be no longer extant in Western or European academic scholarship, are indeed in sacred and secreted reserve, in fortified invitation-only libraries in Kashi, amongst other preserves in India. As too, they are in Old Europe, though not as venerable. I feel it to be of particular import, that I have secured this volume, on this particular date. I will confer with a Vedic Astrological almanac, as to the significance of today's date, in my provincial locale. May all be auspicious! ‡ºº Âçê Aum ‡øà Svasti! Âçç ‡ºΩ

The Dharmic Traditions are a complex and they are complex. All the Dharmic Traditions, if not directly formed and founded by traditional debate, were significantly altered by it. They altered each other with and by it. Dharmic debate is traditional within the Dharmic Traditions. These Dharmic debates, were often great affairs and spectacles, with many spectators, and were sometimes conducted with royal patronage and assent. The debates had clear rules that were culturally sanctioned and agreed to by all parties. The debates were visceral; oration, oratory and orality were primary, yet the physicality and actions of the debators conveyed much meaning, and qualified and emphasised what was stated. Much is misunderstood about the Dharmic Traditions, when the primacy and foundational nature of Dharmic debate is not appreciated, understood or misunderstood. This is an interesting work as it looks at aspects of the system as a complex. I recommend having a grounding in NyƒÅya, before engaging with this work.

This article by Matsubara which I happened upon by the grace of goddess Shrimati Serendipity, is likely from a Japanese journal, and it appears to be the first in a series. So, the aspects of the monograph of Matsubara (1994), appears to have been initially or subsequently serialised in a Japanese journal, the specifics of which are yet to be determined. In his monograph, Matsubara cites a suite of his articles, but not any of this series, which is perplexing and a cause of vexation, but may point to the journal serialisation being published subsequent to the monograph.

I first encountered this work in circa 2004, in hardcopy, whilst deep-grazing and serendipitously communing in an inspired and intuitive spontaneity, as was my practice and fashion, a form of sadhana, within a library call-stack of books, stacked and categorised in isles and shelves, in the Dewey decimal system. This sadhana, has defined and informed my life. I first heard the term "call-stack" from the lips of a librarian more than thirty-five (35) years ago, long before its redefinition and inclusion as a denotation and technical term in Computer Science and other academic disciplines, knowledge areas and ontological domains. Anyway, I was profoundly drawn to this work, and borrowed it, and couldn't bring myself to part with it. I paid the library a pretty-penny for its replacement. I cannot commend, nor recommend, this great work enough. I hold McEvilley, in particular esteem, and embrace him as Guru, for this *magnum opus*.

This is the best digitization of the volume I have been able to find. It had a makeshift cover that detracted from the edition. So, I extracted the cover and prepended the true and correct cover I sourced by the grace of goddess Shrimati Serendipity on the weblog of Sri Vishnudut1926. Vishnudut1926 was manifestly delighted with aspects and tracts of the work. I have as yet been unable to determine if this edition is canonical Pancharatra. On a cursory appraisal of its register, it bears no branding, iconography nor otherwise overt information nor salience, attesting to its veracity as Pancharatra. My intuition informs me, in a positive assessment, it is neo-Pancharatra or a faux and derivative work, modelled somewhat on canonical Pancharatra and other agamic and tantric scriptures of comparable nature and concerns. This is not to be considered a determination. If value is found in the work, the work is of value, regardless of what academia, specialists and/or the tradition(s) attest.

**Purport:**<br>
The Chitrasutra is extracted from the 'Vishnudharmottara Purana'. This article is tangential to our concern on the Pancharatra, but the redactor of the 'Vishnudharmottara Purana' was a Pancharatrin. I gather Mukherji is an artist, as well as an aesthetician, and is interrogating the document through this practitioner-theoretical critical lense, with aspects of a contemporary critical apparatus and non-Indic purview, even though their name bears Indic ancestry. The article emphasises aspects of the text that I would not perceive without it. For this, at minimum, it is useful. It is interesting as the article has made me realise that as a fundamental aspect of the Pancharatrins is deity-work, if not its defining characteristic, they are primarily artisans, if not in the practical sense of material fabrication, but in the sense of theory and philosophy of art to inform that material fabrication, and their concerns subsume iconometry, iconography and iconology, etc. Note, refer: Dave-Mukherji, Parul.

The ‚ÄòCharyagiti‚Äô (xxx) or ‚ÄòCharyapada‚Äô (xxx), is a compendium of lyrical song-poem wisdom-verses in a hybrid complex of languages, often referred to simply as Old Bengali, in the Old Bengali script. Recent scholarship, has defined the language complex further. It contains the earliest known, open discourse and extant Sahajƒ´ya text, or literary example of what is known as the Twilight Language. This work draws principally upon the Charyagiti in its historical analysis and survey of the language and the text.

Without reservation, I determine this a watershed work in the literature. I leaned on it heavily to inform my ritual practice with the Kila post-initiation and empowerment and in writing and citing the historical English Wikipedia 'Vajrakila' article, the substantive content of which has subsequently been split into 'Vajrakilaya' as a ritual tool and 'Dorje Purbha' as the deity of said ritual tool. At this time, there was precious-little academic treatment of Sri Vajrakila in the English language. To me, as a practitioner-scholar, the ishta-devata or yidam and the ritual implement are non-different and other editors, most of which are neither practitioners nor scholars, do not appreciate that finesse. Moreover, my overriding and guiding intentionality, was to maintain the Sanskrit and Indic provenance of the nomenclature and subsume subsequent traditions within that purview to establish a clear spatio-temporal continu√ºm in the presentation. I just feel a calling to add this work to the bibliography. So, rather cavalierly, it has been included. If we come across the term ‚Äúvajra‚Äù in our Tantra, or our commentaries, or the Pancharatriya agamaic samhitas, we will know why. This work is the product of protracted fieldwork. Subsequent to Saturday, June 8, 2024, due to the sublime Grace of goddess Shrimati Serendipity, Our Lady of Luck, I came across "Vakrakila" as the nail-of-adamantium percing the hub and garbha-griha of the Yantra-Chakra-Mandala or 'whorl' of the divine kshetra or loka of Goloka-Vrindavana in the Pancharatriya agmama, the extant fifth chapter of the 'Sri Brahma Samhita', which through divine provenance, was recovered by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in a manner somewhat comparable to the Himalayan terma revelation tradition. I read the Samhita in full at circa nineteen (19) years old, whilst in the Brahmacharya Ashrama and residence of a local Mandhira and attending university and subsequently, after leaving Brahmacharya, chanted the extracted tract of Prayers made by Sri Brahma daily for many, many years, both before and after receiving the esoteric Dzogchen Transmission and the esoteric Dzogchen Pointing-out Instruction. I did not know of Sri 'Vajrakila' when I read the Samhita and neither did the learned and eloquent Sri Srila Bhaktivedanta Saraswati Goswami when they rendered their English-Sanskrit bilingual edition, translation and commentary in academic register and prestige dialect. To find Sri 'Vajrakila' in such an exalted position, was a personal revelation of such profundity, it is presently beyond my capacity to express with fidelity.

I envisaged the necessity of this work. I am overjoyed it has been conducted. Thankfully, I found it. It is a premier example of academic discourse analysis and the literature review of a complex theological, phenomenological and soteriological concept, that traverses multiple ontological domains in the Indic Dharmic and Ayurvedic Traditions, amongst others.

This is quite useful as it is relatively recent and amongst other things, ventures a brief survey of the way English scholarship has endeavoured to progressively define 'tantra' and what it signifies and points to.

* Urgyen, Tulku (auth. & orrat.); Kunsang, Erik Pema \[a.k.a. Schmidt, Erik Hein] (trans.); Schmidt, Marcia Binder (comp.) & Tweed, Michael (ed.) (2001). 'Vajra Speech: Pith Instructions for the Dzogchen Yogi'. With a Preface by Erik and Marcia. (NB: Translated from an undated and unspecified Tibetan text or compendium of text excerpts from multiple sources and/or oral transcriptions.). First edition. Greenview Garden, Hong Kong: Rangjung Yeshe Publications. ISBN 9627341444 (pbk) 

**Purport:**<br>
This stands as an exceptionally valuable resource for the serious practitioner of Dzogchen within the Nyingma tradition. The text offers direct, pragmatic and experiential guidance distilled from oral instructions and written notes by senior disciples of the Rinpoche, presenting the essence of Dzogchen contemplation, conduct and view in a manner that is accessible without sacrificing the profundity of the Rinpoche's original teachings. The translators, compilers and editors, all established figures in the field of Himalayan Bauddhadharma sacred literature, bring a wealth of experiential knowledge and linguistic competence, ensuring that the transmission remains faithful to the living tradition. That said, the publication does not aspire to the standards of academic sophistication nor critical philological rigor of their other work. The source material is acknowledged as composite and, at times, extemporaneous, with the translation prioritizing clarity and immediate applicability over textual criticism or historical contextualization. The editorial apparatus is minimal, lacking extensive footnotes, critical apparatus, or the inclusion of the original Tibetan script or transcription for probity and the book is presented in a standard paperback format typical of practitioner-oriented works from Rangjung Yeshe Publications during this period. Whilst 'Vajra Speech' is indispensable for those seeking practical engagement with Dzogchen pith instructions, it does not constitute a scholarly edition nor a comprehensive critical presentation of the material. Its strength lies in its capacity to communicate the experiential core of the teachings to a contemporary English-literate audience, rather than in that of a refined academic register.
