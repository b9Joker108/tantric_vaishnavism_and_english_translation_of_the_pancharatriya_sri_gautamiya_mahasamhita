Four-armed Shrimati Sarasvati (c. 10th - 11th century), image by The Walters Art Museum, with a (cc) Creative Commons Licence. Carved from soapstone native to Uttar Pradesh, Northern India, where the sculpture was also initially sited. Sculpture dimensions sans base: height: 71.2 cm; width: 55.6 cm; depth: 24.4 cm. Acquired in Varanasi (?), India, in 1969 by The Walters Art Museum, Baltimore, Maryland, U. S. A. The Goddess of Music, Learning and the Arts, plucks the Veena, a stringed musical instrument, whilst holding a palm leaf manuscript in Her left rear hand, which rests on the calve of Her left leg. The divine attribute of the Manuscript, alludes to Her domain of Knowledge, particularly Sacred Knowledge, which the goddess guards and protects. Maa Saraswathi is worshipped pervasively throughout the Dharmic Traditions, within the Sanatana Dharma (Hindus), Jaina Dharma and Buddhists Dharma traditions, amongst others, all of which worship Sarasvati, having adapted Her from earlier Animist traditions, which held that all natural objects are sentient and enspirited and have a spiritual nature or essence. Sarasvathi, takes Her name from a formerly significant river in India, that once flower all the way to the coast (now largely dry, though flows intermittently, post-deluge). Maa Sarasvati is an ancient riverine deity, who personifies the abundant gifts and bounty bestowed by the river, not least of which was the provision of life-giving water to support life in the region, and also the provision of invaluable irrigation for crops and livestock. Legends of Her beneficence extended to Her bestowal of Knowledge, the Divine Word (from Sri Vac Devi, with whom She synchronised), and Sound, to humankind, especially amongst later Sanatana Dharma (Hindu) traditions. ‡•ê ‡§π‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§ê‡§Ç ‡§π‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡•ê ‡§µ‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à ‡§®‡§Æ‡§É ||

# Annotated Bibliography (3B: L - Z) of the English translation of the 'Gautamiya Samhita' or 'Gautamiya Mahatantram', a Vaishnava Tantric Pancharatra Agama, with extensive Frontmatter & Introduction #

by Beauford A. Stenberg

**Note:** The (1A & 1B): Frontmatter and extensive Introduction and Survey-of-the- Field the (2A & 2B): Sanskrit original and Hindi commentary, along with annotations, English translation, analysis and commentary, will be complemented by (3A: A‚Ää-‚ÄäK & 3B: L -Z): this Annotated Bibliography. All three (3) will be progressively and incrementally published in Medium separately, as complimentary living documents, due to publication number-of-word restrictions per published page, according to Medium (online) Webmaster's site policy and the electronic medium, proper. I may also institute (4): An Index of sorts, to collectively house a Table-of-Contents (TOC), and hypertext linkages, to assist ease of electronic navigation and wayfinding, for my audience. I have resolved not to place this work behind a paywall. That said, I reserve the right to review that determination in future, once the work has been well-progressed and well onway to realisation.

This item is the fourth of five volumes of a suite. The first volume of which, is my principal secondary resource. It took me circa three (3) weeks of solid work of protracted research and endeavour to realise it. It was not been cited in any work I have so far read. The first volume out of five (5), is effectively a monograph on the Pancharatra as a class. It is the first substantive monographic work on the topic in English, that I have secured. As such, I cherish it greatly as my guiding light and I am actually unwrapping it ever-so-slowly, savouring and integrating each sip of the nectarine elixir and fully digesting it, before progressing. Actually, before fully progressing my study of this work and progressing with the Gautamiya Mahatantram translation, I have somewhat been seduced into translating an emic Hindi work on Vaishnava Tantra, geared towards academically oriented to the cohort of the young adult Vaishnava, but is of course useful for those outside this cohort, as an entry into the topic, and the doctrine and sadhana proper, which it treates. I actually anticipate, that I will progress the translations incrementally in tandem. NB: Beauford, reference and file the other four (4) volumes.
