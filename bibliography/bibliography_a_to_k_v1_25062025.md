# Annotated Bibliography (3A: A-K) of the English translation of the 'Gautamiya Samhita' or 'Gautamiya Mahatantram', a Vaishnava Tantric Pancharatra Agama, with extensive Frontmatter & Introduction #

by Sri Nagahari-dasa Goswamin Avadhutaka
(a.k.a. Beauford A. Stenberg)

**Note:** The (1A & 1B): Frontmatter and extensive Introduction and Survey-of-the-Field the (2A & 2B): Sanskrit original and Hindi commentary, along with annotations, English translation, analysis and commentary, will be complemented by (3A: A - K & 3B: L -Z): this Annotated Bibliography. All three (3) will be progressively and incrementally published in Medium separately, as complimentary living documents, due to publication number-of-word restrictions per published page, according to Medium (online) Webmaster's site policy and the electronic medium, proper. I may also institute (4): An Index of sorts, to collectively house a Table-of-Contents (TOC), and hypertext linkages, to assist ease of electronic navigation and wayfinding, for my audience. I have resolved not to place this work behind a paywall. That said, I reserve the right to review that determination in future, once the work has been well-progressed and well onway to realisation.

## Annotated Bibliography ##

**A first note:** I have taken liberties with the bibliographic details in this work. I have standardised titles of works, authorship, publication details and other saliences, into the somewhat prevalent forms and current standardised conventions of the Anglocentric Romanisation of Indic and Sanskritic languages, amongst others, in English, in order to standardise and normalise for the general reader and to ease and facilitate my electronic filing and discovery of sources. As I have aimed to include as much bibliographic information as possible, which will also function as a literature review of the salient extended discourse in the field; with the aid of the Internet, the true and correct details, should be easily discoverable, for those who require such specifics.

**A second note:** An understanding of the complexities and finesse of a language, is only as good as the dictionary and authoritative sources one has access to, and the direct experience of the language one has received. Of course, English speaking persons who are bilingual in Sanskrit as a second language, tend to use English-Sanskrit bilingual dictionaries, such as Monier-Williams (xxx) and Apte (xxx), amongst others. In my personal methodology, on occasion, I will resort to two (2) voluminous 19th century domestic Indic Sanskritic dictionaries: the 'Vacaspatyam' and the 'Sabdakalpadruma', which stand apart from other such works for their modern style and technique. Both the volumes are replete with quotes from the contemporary literature, in explication of terms, and to attest to their analysis and its veracity. In this respect, they takes proverbial 'leaves out of the book' of 'The Oxford English Dictionary', which in contradistinction, uses direct quotations from historical sources to establish contextualised meaning in the occurrence, and often first attestations of different usages or accretions, around the initial core of the term and it's etymology. Thus charting lexical and semantic polysemy and multivalence. These two voluminous indigenous or domestic Sanskrit dictionaries, may be understood as "a bridge between the dictionary and the encyclopedia", according to 'Sanskrit EBooks \[online]'. Monier and 'Sanskrit Worterbuch' of Oto Bohtlingk and the 'Sanskrit-English Dictionary' by Vamana Sivarama Apte, are the works of excellence in this tradition.

** 'Sabda Kalpadruma': A Comprehensive Sanskrit Dictionary in 5¬†volumes.**

'Sabda Kalpadruma' is a well known Sanskrit lexicon compiled by a few Bengali scholars at the instance of Raja Radhakanta Deb of Bengal. In this compendium, the words have been analyzed into their base-forms and suffixes, their genders determined and their Sanskrit synonyms noted.

Volume 1 Volume 2 Volume 3 Volume 4 Volume 5

**'Vacaspatyam': A Comprehensive Sanskrit Dictionaryin 6¬†volumes.**

'Vacaspatyam' is a Sanskrit Lexicon, of 5442 pages, by Pandit Taranatha Tarkavacaspati, Calcutta. It is very full up to the end of the letter Pa (page 4550), whilst the rest of the alphabet is squeezed into 900 pages! It is said that the Bengali Government, which largely subsidized the undertaking, ordered the protracted endeavour to be curtailed. If that is so, it did a very unwise thing. (Col. GA Jacob in "A Handful Of Popular Maxims Current In Sanskrit Literature")

"Exploring early palm-leaf manuscripts from the NGMPP collection, I came across some rare Vai·π£·πáava Tantras which were hardly known from any other source. In this lecture, I will talk about four of such texts: the SvƒÅyambhuvapa√±carƒÅtra, DevƒÅm·πõta-pa√±carƒÅtra, Jayottaratantra, and the VƒÅsudevakalpa of the MahƒÅlak·π£m·πÉhitƒÅ, which are preserved in palm-leaf manuscripts of the 11‚Äì14th centuries.

The first three texts are earlier than the texts which are regarded until now as the earliest PƒÅ√±carƒÅtra texts. The fourth text, the VƒÅsudevakalpa, is exclusively concerned with the composite form of Lak·π£mƒ´ and VƒÅsudeva, and is comparable to early ≈öƒÅktatantras in certain aspects in its structure and contents. These texts together provide a broader picture of Vai·π£·πáava Tantricism, and suggest that what was happening in the ≈öaiva fold was very similar to what was happening in the Vai·π£·πáava fold."

Ostensibly, this article has nothing to do with tantra. That said, it has both an interesting use of honey and bee metaphorical symbolism in the Vedas and also usefully frames the metaphorical flash of thunderous-lightening in the Brahman-Consciousness. This is useful groundwork to integrate into the traditional usage of the the honey-bee yogin motif of the consummate yogin or avadhuta, especially in the employ of the motif in relation to Sri Dattatreya. The flash of thunderous-lightening and Brahman-Consciousness, is useful for discussions on the Vajra and its employ in the Vajrayana. It is useful to note that the traditional Sanskritic title of Vajracharya, denoted a tantric teacher-adept, not delimited by the specificity of the tantric and esoteric Buddhadharma tradition. This is just a personal note, for later development and integration.

This is an important work. Sri Ramanujacharya is the first attested unambigously theistic Vaishnava Vedantic theologian, known to posterity from the vicissitudes, fickleness and selectivity, of history. It is best to remember that history is a construction, that we can only ever endeavour to approach truth, never reveal or attain it. Since, I became aware that Ramanuja didn't quote from the Shrimad Bhagavatham Mahapuranam, and aware that He authored a commentary on the Sri Vishnu Purana, and that this scripture contains an interior and intimate devotional perspective on the lilas of Sri Govinda and the blessed Gopis, I have become intrigued to find a dedicated work that gives academic treatment on this aspect of Ramanuja and the historicity of the Vedanta. Did Ramanuja have access to the Bhagavatham or not? Was Ramanuja aware of the Bhagavatham? Did Ramanuja just favour the Vishnu Purana over the Bhagavatham, and if so why? Was it something specific to the Vishnu Purana that inflamed and incited Ramanuja's devotional and theistic theology? If so, what?

This work is useful for our purposes, but its aspiration to a scholarly and academic register suffers from being the product of a non-native English speaker and has not been edited by a native English speaker, privy to an appropriate academic and scholarly register and the conventions of academic publishing in English. I also note an inherent and insidious bias in the presentation and framing of matters related to Hindu culture and religion.
