# Extended Wylie Transcription System (EWTS) #

The **Extended Wylie Transliteration Scheme (EWTS)** was established to address the need for a comprehensive, unambiguous, and computer-friendly system for transliterating Tibetan script using the Latin alphabet. Its rationale, provenance, and authority are as follows:

### Rationale

- **Faithful Representation of Written Tibetan:**  
  EWTS, like the original Wylie system, was designed to *precisely transcribe the orthography* of written Tibetan, not its pronunciation. This approach was necessary because Tibetan spelling and pronunciation diverged significantly after the 11th century, and previous schemes failed to represent either aspect with full fidelity[1][2][5][7][8].
- **Compatibility with Standard Keyboards:**  
  The scheme uses only characters available on a standard English-language keyboard, making it accessible for digital input and typesetting[2][3][5][7].
- **Comprehensiveness:**  
  EWTS extends the original Wylie system to cover all forms of Tibetan literary production, including Sanskrit transliterations, extended characters, and complex stacks, which the original Wylie system did not fully address[3][6].

### Provenance

- **Original Wylie System (1959):**  
  The foundation was laid by Turrell V. Wylie in his landmark 1959 article, *A Standard System of Tibetan Transcription* (Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies), which quickly became the standard in Tibetan studies in the West[1][2][4][5][7][8].
- **Development of EWTS:**  
  The Extended Wylie Transliteration Scheme was developed collaboratively in the early 2000s by the Tibetan and Himalayan Library (THL) at the University of Virginia. The project involved a consortium of Tibetanists, digital humanists, and software developers, who expanded Wylie’s original rules to handle the full complexity of Tibetan script and its use in digital environments[3][6].

### Authority and Maintenance

- **Institutional Authority:**  
  The **Tibetan and Himalayan Library (THL)** at the University of Virginia is the principal authority responsible for the development, publication, and ongoing maintenance of EWTS. The scheme is maintained by a team of scholars and technical experts affiliated with THL, ensuring both scholarly rigor and practical applicability[3][6].
- **Community Adoption:**  
  EWTS has become the *de facto* standard for Tibetan input and digital text processing in academic, archival, and software contexts, especially in the West[1][3][5].
- **Documentation and Updates:**  
  The official EWTS specification, documentation, and updates are publicly available through the THL website and associated digital resources[3][6][9].

In summary, **EWTS** is a rigorously developed, community-vetted, and institutionally maintained standard, established to meet the needs of both scholarly precision and digital practicality in the transliteration of Tibetan script[1][2][3][5][6][7][8].

Please ennumerate all the rules of Tibetan EWTS for an appendix of my book

Below is a comprehensive enumeration of the **rules of the Extended Wylie Transliteration Scheme (EWTS)** for Tibetan, suitable for inclusion as an appendix in your book. This list synthesizes the formal rules as codified by the Tibetan and Himalayan Library (THL) and related authoritative sources[1][2][4].

## Appendix: Rules of Tibetan EWTS (Extended Wylie Transliteration Scheme)

### 1. **Transliteration Order**
- Tibetan characters in a syllable are transliterated **from left to right**.
- In stacks, transliterate **from top to bottom**.
- The vowel is transliterated **after the final consonant** of the root letter or stack[2].

### 2. **Implicit and Explicit Vowels**
- If there is **no explicit vowel mark**, insert “a” after the final consonant of the root letter or stack to represent the inherent vowel[2].

### 3. **Period for Disambiguation**
- Use a **period (.)** to separate two consonants that would otherwise be ambiguous or could be misread as a stack[2].

### 4. **Plus-Sign for Non-Standard Stacks**
- Use a **plus-sign (+)** between consonants in a **non-standard Tibetan stack**[1][2].
  - *Example:* སཏྟྭ་ → sat+t+wa

### 5. **Plus-Sign for Multiple Vowel Signs**
- Use a **plus-sign (+)** between transliteration equivalents for **multiple vowel signs** above and/or below the same Tibetan stack.
  - Vowels are transliterated **from bottom to top**[1][2].
  - *Example:* བྲེུ་ → bru+e

### 6. **Equivalence of Plus-Sign and Non-Plus-Sign Forms**
- The transliteration of a standard Tibetan stack using the **plus-sign (+)** is equivalent to the form without it[1].

### 7. **Capitalization for Full-Form Letters**
- **Capital R** is used to indicate the **full-form of ra** when it is the top letter of a non-standard Tibetan stack[1][2].
  - *Example:* ཪྣ་ → R+na

### 8. **Full-Form ra in Standard Stacks**
- The full-formed **ra** in the standard Tibetan stacks (rnya, rla, rwa) is transliterated as lower-case “r”[1][2].
  - *Example:* རྙ་ → rnya

### 9. **Capital W, Y, R for Full Forms**
- **Capital W, Y, and R** are used to transliterate the **full form of wa, ya, and ra** respectively, except when they are the top-most letter[1][2].

### 10. **Sanskrit and Extended Characters**
- EWTS includes conventions for transliterating Sanskrit-origin stacks and extended Tibetan characters, using the plus-sign and capitalization as above[4].

### 11. **Punctuation**
- Tibetan punctuation marks (such as shad, tsheg) have specific EWTS equivalents[4].

### 12. **Numerals**
- Tibetan numerals are transliterated with their Arabic equivalents (0–9)[4].

### 13. **Special Characters**
- Extended characters (retroflex, reversed vowels, etc.) are handled with additional conventions, often using capitalization or diacritics as specified in EWTS tables[4].
