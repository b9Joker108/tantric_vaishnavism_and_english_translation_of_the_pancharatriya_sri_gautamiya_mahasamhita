I wanted the specific names

The **specific names** of the Vaikhanasa Samhitas that are extant and referenced in scholarship are as follows. While the *total* list of 60 is traditional and not all are available, the names of the 17 currently available samhitas (with 8 printed, 2 fully available in manuscript, and 7 partially available) are not comprehensively listed in the search results. However, based on authoritative sources and the available information, the **main Vaikhanasa Samhitas known and studied today are**:

- **Atri Samhita**
- **Bhrigu Samhita**
- **Kashyapa Samhita**
- **Marichi Samhita**

These four are the principal samhitas, each attributed to one of Rishi Vikhanasa’s disciples, and form the core texts for Vaikhanasa ritual and doctrine[2][3][7].

Other samhitas mentioned in connection with the Vaikhanasa or Pancharatra traditions (though some may overlap or be more prominent in Pancharatra) include:

- Vaikhānasa Samhita (sometimes used as a general term for the tradition or as a specific text)[1]
- Garga Samhita
- Gautama Samhita
- Kapinjala Samhita
- Bharadvaja Samhita
- Bhargava Samhita
- Parasara Samhita
- Vasistha Samhita[6]

**Note:** The search results do not provide a definitive, itemized list of all 17 Vaikhanasa Samhitas currently available, nor do they specify which are printed, fully available, or partially available. Most published studies and temple traditions focus on the four principal samhitas (Atri, Bhrigu, Kashyapa, Marichi), with some references to additional texts preserved in manuscript form.

If you require the exact list as per a specific 2015 thesis or a particular scholarly edition, you may need to consult that thesis or a specialized catalog of Vaikhanasa manuscripts, as this information is not fully detailed in the search results provided.
